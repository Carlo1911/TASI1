"The new main camera is a custom tailored 16MP sensor with f/1.7 aperture, while the secondary camera is a 20MP telephoto lens with f/2.6 aperture,  and is used primarily for depth of field and zooming into photos. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 3T sports a 16MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture, Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS), and Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF)",http://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-5-camera-oneplus-3t-780368/
"The OnePlus 5 camera professes to take good photos but how does it compare to the competition? Find out in our OnePlus 5 vs LG G6, HTC U11, Sony Xperia XZ Premium, Pixel XL and Galaxy S8 camera shootout!",http://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-5-camera-oneplus-3t-780368/
"The OnePlus 3T shipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, which at the time was the fastest chip you could get in a phone. The new OnePlus 5 is even faster, with the new Snapdragon 835 chip, which is the same found in the US versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus and the HTC U11",http://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-5-vs-oneplus-3t-781795/
"The OnePlus 3T came with 6 GB of RAM,which is still more than what you can get from most current flagship smartphones. The standard OnePlus 5 can be bought with either 6 or 8 GB of RAM, and either with 64 GB or 128 GB of onboard storage, compared to just 64 GB for the OnePlus 3T. The OnePlus 5 has plenty of memory and storage for most users, although it does not have the option to add more storage due to the lack of a microSD card slot",http://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-5-vs-oneplus-3t-781795/
"The OnePlus 3T launched with a 3,400 mAh battery, but thanks in part to its thinner design, the OnePlus 5 comes with a slightly smaller 3,300 mAh battery. However, the phone is supposed to last up to 20 percent longer on a single charge compared to its predecessor, thanks to the more power-efficient Snapdragon 835 chip. Both phones also feature the super fast Dash Charge technology",http://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-5-vs-oneplus-3t-781795/
"The 16 MP rear camera of the OnePlus 3T proved to be a very good and reliable shooter, but the company decided to take the big leap by putting in a dual lens setup on the OnePlus 5, with 16 and 20 MP sensors",http://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-5-vs-oneplus-3t-781795/
"On the software front, both the OnePlus 3T and the OnePlus 5 feature the same software package with the latest version of the company’s own OxygenOS, which is based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat",	http://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-5-vs-oneplus-3t-781795/
"The earlier OnePlus 3 was fast -- it outpaced the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG G5 and HTC 10 in diagnostic benchmark testing scores. This time around, the 3T beats the 3 in the same benchmarks and is just as fast as the Google Pixel and LeEco LePro 3 -- two newer phones that have the same Snapdragon 821 processor as the 3T",https://www.cnet.com/products/oneplus-3t/review/2/
"The keyboard is as quick and responsive as you'd expect. If you plan to download a lot of apps and fill up storage with photos and video, you may want to get the 128GB version to give yourself some breathing room. A nearly full 64GB phone could slow down operations later on",https://www.cnet.com/products/oneplus-3t/review/2/
"OnePlus gave the 3T a bigger battery than the 3: 3,400mAh instead of 3,000mAh. As expected, it lasts longer. In our lab tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the 3T lasted an average of 16 hours and 56 -- a notable 2.5 hours longer than the 3",https://www.cnet.com/products/oneplus-3t/review/2/
"The front-facing camera on the OnePlus 3T jumps from 8 to 16 megapixels, and it's supposed to perform better in low light too. The selfies I took looked smoother and sharper than the ones on the 3, and this was extra noticeable when I zoomed in or cropped the photo",https://www.cnet.com/products/oneplus-3t/review/2/
"The 3T runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but OnePlus said that both the 3 and 3T will upgrade to 7.0 Nougat in the near future",https://www.cnet.com/products/oneplus-3t/review/2/
"Aside from the battery boost and some slightly better selfies, the 3T isn't a phenomenal upgrade. And remember, you're going to get those software updates too. Rest assured, the 3 isn't an obsolete device that you need to run out and replace",https://www.cnet.com/products/oneplus-3t/review/2/
"Its updates are worth the extra money. And if you have room in the budget, go with the 128GB variant",https://www.cnet.com/products/oneplus-3t/review/2/
