"It does everything really, really well, and while it may not truly excel in areas such as screen resolution and camera quality, the OnePlus 3T is still astonishingly good value for what is a serious flagship contender.
The OnePlus 3T is something of a surprise offering. 
t’s not like the OnePlus 3 had any major flaws either – it scored a highly respectable 4.5 stars in our in-depth review, and comfortably made it into our list of the top 10 best phones in the world. 
All that aside though, the OnePlus 3T is another stellar offering, with super performance, a strong feature set and a still-reasonable price tag.
You had to pay more to own a OnePlus handset with the 3T. The firm’s cheaper OnePlus X had been dead for a while, and the OnePlus 3T price started at $439 (£399, around AU$580) for the 64GB model.  
We’re not going to spend too much time talking about the design of the OnePlus 3T. Why? Because it’s identical to the OnePlus 3, and we mean identical. 
In fact, the only new feature design-wise is the addition of a new color variant for the 64GB version: gunmetal. This is a darker grey than the silver which adorned the OnePlus 3, and joins ‘soft gold’ to offer two shade choices. The 128GB OnePlus 3T only comes in gunmetal though. 
In the run-up to the OnePlus 3T launch there were several reports suggesting the new phone would drop the AMOLED screen technology used on the OnePlus 3 in favor of a LCD screen – luckily that didn’t happen. 
The OnePlus 3T may not have a flagship price tag, but when it comes to performance and power it’s up there with the best of them. 
The OnePlus 3T launched with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, which was a little disappointing with Android 7 Nougat available – but don’t fear as OnePlus has pushed out the update to Google's latest software.
Tap the app drawer icon in the dock at the bottom of the display and you’ll find a vertically scrolling list of all your installed applications – of which very few come preinstalled.  
With a heap of power under the hood, a full HD AMOLED display, a larger 128GB storage option and a headphone jack, the OnePlus 3T comes well equipped for music, movies and gaming. 
Both options are perfectly serviceable – and connect a set of headphones to the OnePlus 3T and the sound output is more than reasonable.
Gaming is another highly enjoyable feature of the OnePlus 3T, with the punchier chipset providing faster load times and smoother gameplay. The phone also doesn’t get too hot during extending periods of play, making it comfortable to hold during epic battles and races.
The OnePlus 3T sports Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 chipset – that’s the same chip you’ll find in the Google Pixel and Pixel XL – and with 6GB of RAM providing ample support this is a serious power player.
Performing the same benchmark on the OnePlus 3, running Android 6 and connected to the same Wi-Fi network, we achieved a multi-core score of 3,898. 
The most welcome addition to the OnePlus 3T over the OnePlus 3 is the bigger battery. The firm has managed to squeeze in a larger power pack into exactly the same frame – a feat which in itself should be applauded. 
With the OnePlus 3 that sort of usage required us to top up before leaving the office each evening, but with the OnePlus 3T it's not necessary.
If you do find yourself running low you can use the Dash charging feature to quickly top up. A Dash charging block is included in the box, and you’ll need this to charge the OnePlus 3T quickly. 
On the rear of the OnePlus 3T nothing has changed over the OnePlus 3, with the same Sony-made 16MP rear camera protruding from the metal uni-body, and a single LED flash sitting below it.
For those who want greater control over their snaps the OnePlus 3T offers a pretty comprehensive manual mode, accessed by tapping the menu icon in the top-left corner, enabling you to tweak various settings such as ISO, white balance, contrast and shutter speed.  
The big difference in the camera department here is round the front. The OnePlus 3T boasts a 16MP front snapper – matching the megapixels you get on the rear. Unlike on the rear it isn’t a Sony lens, so the quality isn’t quite as good, but compared to the 8MP offering on the OnePlus 3 (or most other selfie cams on flagship phones) and it’s excellent.
The OnePlus 3T is perhaps a smartphone the firm didn’t need to make, but it did so because it wanted to give users an improved experience without having to wait until 2017 to get their hands on an all-new handset. 
The OnePlus 3T has the same target market as the OnePlus 3 – fans of the brand, those looking for something a little bit different and people on the hunt for a bargain.
You can't! Well, it's highly unlikely you can. OnePlus has stopped making the 3T and no longer sells it through its website. There may be some stock knocking around at a handful or retailers, but once it's gone, it's gone. Don't fear though, the OnePlus 5 has arrived to take its place.

If you’re looking for a flagship smartphone but don’t want to break the bank on the latest Samsung or iPhone the answer here is simple: yes, buy the OnePlus 3T – you won’t be disappointed.

Hell, even if your budget can stretch to the handsets from the bigger names we urge you to at least consider the OnePlus 3T. 

For those who committed to the OnePlus 3 just six months ago, however, the arrival of the 3T is a little harder to swallow. 

While the OnePlus 3T is an improvement over the handset you're holding in your hand right now – the battery life is the standout upgrade – it's difficult to justify trading in for the newer model.
At $439 (£399, around AU$580) for the 64GB model the OnePlus 3T is still much cheaper than its flagship rivals while offering an almost comparable experience. 

It won’t have the wide appeal as the likes of Apple or Samsung, but for those in the know – and willing to give OnePlus a go – the 3T is a real gem.

For those who've already purchased a OnePlus 3 the 3T launch may be viewed as irritating rather than exciting, but the Chinese startup has another excellent handset on its books. 

The OnePlus 3T improves on the OnePlus 3 in several key areas, notably improved battery life and slicker performance. It’s a shame the design hasn’t been tweaked in a more noticeable way to signal that you have a new phone in your hands, but other than that it’s difficult to find fault.

Some will point to the lack of expandable storage as a stumbling block, while its larger size rules it out for those wanting something a little more manageable in the hand.  

It does everything really, really well, and while it may not truly excel in areas such as screen resolution and camera quality, the OnePlus 3T is still astonishingly good value for what is a serious flagship contender.

OnePlus’ reasoning for bumping up this camera is to appeal to the Facebook Live/Snapchat/selfie generation – and if you fall into this category you’ll likely be impressed. 

Our selfies came out bright, clear and full of detail – and if you aren’t looking your best you can enhance yourself with beauty mode.



There’s also the option to save images as RAW files, which will please the more serious photographers among you.

The OnePlus 3T's camera provides a solid showing in most situations; while it’s not quite up there with the newest iPhones or Samsungs you could do a lot worse than this snapper. 

Images can look a little darker – especially in low light – compared to those from the competition, but OnePlus says it’s engineered its camera this way to give a result that's truer to what your eyes see in the same scenario, instead of brightening up dark areas artificially. It’s a matter of personal preference which results you prefer.



Fire up the camera app and it’s more of the same from OnePlus, with a relatively clean interface giving you control over HDR (high dynamic range) and HQ (high quality) modes. 

HDR helps to brighten darker areas in your photos, while HQ mode captures more detail – although you can’t use both modes together. In our time with the OnePlus 3T we found there wasn’t a huge difference between the two modes, and we tended to opt for auto HDR as default.

We plugged in at 12.18 with the battery at 65% to see just how fast Dash charging is. OnePlus claims a 30-minute blast is enough to give you a full day of use – although that of course depends on how much you use your handset. 

After five minutes the 3T had already regained 8%, getting up to 73%, and after 10 minutes it had hit 80%. At the 15-minute mark we were up to 86%, which was swiftly followed by 90% after 20 minutes; 25% percent in 20 minutes is a good enough blast for a night out.  

After half an hour we were up to 95% – a gain of 40% in 30 minutes. That’s not bad, but it does mean OnePlus’ half hour for a full day claim looks a little ropey.  

Turn the OnePlus 3T off and then plug in the Dash charger, though, and you’ll get a faster top-up, which just about gets the firm out of the hole it's dug for itself.

If you’re a more casual smartphone user you may even get a day and a half from the OnePlus 3T – and this sort of performance puts it on a par with the likes of the Galaxy S7 Edge.

We ran the TechRadar 90-minute Full HD video test on the OnePlus 3T, with screen brightness at max, Wi-Fi connected and accounts syncing in the background. When the hour and a half was up the OnePlus 3T had lost just 14% of its 100% charge.  

That’s an excellent result – the OnePlus 3 lost 23% in the same test – and the 3T's showing matches the Galaxy S7 (13%) and S7 Edge (14%).

It means battery capacity has increased from 3,000mAh in the OnePlus 3 to 3,400mAh in the 3T – and it shows.

The OnePlus 3T now comfortably lasts a whole day (from 7am to 11pm) on a single charge, and we usually had at least 10% left in the tank at bedtime. 

Our typical usage included a couple of hours of Spotify streaming, many WhatsApp messages, a few calls, two hours of gaming, a range of email activity and a healthy slug of web browser and other app activity (news, sport, etc). 

What does that mean for day-to-day use? A super-slick smartphone, with apps loading promptly and effortless multi-tasking as you jump between different applications.  

Load times for games such as Real Racing 3, Boom Beach and Animation Throwdown are improved over the OnePlus 3, and it feels like the 3T is a top flagship phone.

And it's all the more impressive when you remember the price. In short, you can throw anything at the OnePlus 3T and it’ll gobble it up with ease.

OnePlus reckons the 3T can topple the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 in terms of speed, with the new chipset coupled with a new file system making everything slicker than on the OnePlus 3. 

Running the Geekbench 4 CPU benchmark on the Android 6 software, the OnePlus 3T managed an average multi-core score of 4,313, putting it above the Sony Xperia X and Google Pixel XL.

However, running the same test after upgrading the OnePlus 3T to Android 7 Nougat and the results are quite so impressive. It now averages 3,894, which is still a strong showing, but it brings it much closer in line with its predecessor.



The built-in speaker on the base of the OnePlus 3T kicks out a decent volume, with the ability to fill a room for casual listening (or watching the latest YouTube craze) in relative comfort; just don’t expect solid bass or exceptional clarity. 

Video playback is also great on the OnePlus 3T, with the Full HD display providing clear visuals and bright colors – although it doesn’t have quite the same clarity as the QHD resolution displays of the Galaxy S7 Edge, HTC 10 and LG G5. 

The file explorer app is a handy addition when it comes to easily locating video files transferred onto the handset, while Google’s Play Movies application gives you access to a wide range of films and TV shows to rent and buy.

The main preinstalled media apps are Google’s offerings, with Play Music enabling you to access your own songs that you've transferred onto the OnePlus 3T, as well as giving you the option to use the firm’s own pay-monthly streaming service. 

Yet OnePlus has seen fit to include its own, simpler music player app as well – as it did on the OnePlus 3 – giving you a cleaner, fuss-free offering if you so wish. 

Other than the stock apps and Google’s suite, OnePlus has ensured the 3T is kept lean, allowing you to put your own stamp on your phone via the Play Store. 

While on paper the OnePlus 3T and 3 have the same software, the newer handset does have a few subtle changes.  

There’s a new wallpaper, the 'clear all' button in the multi-tasking menu is bigger, circular and centralized, and the screen brightness slider in the notification bar now has a toggle for auto-brightness.

The interface is easy to navigate, and flows well between menus and screens with no sign of lag.

And the company isn't stopping there, as it's already confirmed that the OnePlus 3T will get Android O before the end of the year, though we'd expect this will be the last major update the phone gets.

As for the current build, it’s not quite stock Android on the 3T, with OnePlus’ own Oxygen OS running over the top of Google’s software, giving you additional features and customization options. 

Day-to-day, though, it’s very much Android, with a clear, fuss-free interface. Swipe down from the top of the display and the notification panel offers a range of editable quick settings and a screen brightness slider.

One of the main upgrades in the OnePlus 3T is on-screen performance, with the Chinese firm claiming it’s faster than the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 thanks to the new chipset stuffed inside. 

Other than that though, everything is pretty much the same as six months ago on the OnePlus 3 – which again, isn’t a bad thing.

This allowed the OnePlus 3T to maintain the same slim profile and bright, vibrant display. The AMOLED panel on the 3T also features the same Full HD resolution, resulting in a 401ppi pixel density.

What that means is text, images and video are clear and smooth – although the display lacks the supreme clarity of the QHD-toting LG G6 and Galaxy S8.



OnePlus introduced a limited edition color for the 128GB model more recently, but the Midnight Black hue has sold out is most regions - so you'll be lucky to get hold of it now.

The OnePlus 3T is still a premium-looking and feeling device, which doesn’t look out of place alongside the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, iPhone 7 Plus and LG G5.

However there are newer flagships on the market, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 push the design envelope even further - the OnePlus 3T hasn't been left behind, but it doesn't look quite so good next to 2017's Android flagships.

Considering the OnePlus 3T is comfortably cheaper than all of these handsets though, it’s still rather impressive.

Same weight (158g), same size (152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm), same aluminum uni-body, same rear camera protrusion, same factory fitted (but removable) screen protector…. you get the picture.

That’s up from the $399 (£329, around AU$450) for the OnePlus 3 – but there was another storage/price option with the OnePlus 3T. 

OnePlus introduced a new 128GB storage option for its fourth generation flagship, which set you back $479, (£439, around AU$630) – it's a move that will likely delight some users, with the firm continuing to shun expandable memory features such as a microSD slot.

The OnePlus 3T went on sale in the US on November 22, while Europe had to wait a few more days for its OnePlus 3T release date of November 28.

In a rush? Check out our OnePlus 3T video review below!

So why the new model? OnePlus tells us its engineers found solutions to some nagging issues on the 3, and they didn’t want to wait another six months for the OnePlus 5 launch on June 20, 2017. 

That means you’re getting slicker performance, longer battery life, a punchier selfie snapper and a new storage option – at a slightly higher price.

It’s a move that’s likely to frustrate early adopters of the OnePlus 3, as the company they’ve put their faith in has suddenly relegated their handset to a second-class citizen, and relatively soon after its launch. 

It’s a phone we didn’t expect the Chinese startup to launch when it unveiled its 2016 flagship, the OnePlus 3, just six months prior to the 3T’s arrival. But here we are. 

The OnePlus 3T has killed off the OnePlus 3 after half a year, but now the 3T is dead as well thanks to the arrival of the OnePlus 5. 

The 3T wasn’t a completely new phone – even OnePlus admits that, instead billing it as new variant of the 3, and too right - the OnePlus 3T has the same design, screen, RAM, rear camera and fingerprint scanner as the phone it’s shoving out of the limelight.

"OnePlus has released a matte-black version of the excellent 3T. Like the iPhone 7 before it, dark black is probably the perfect colour for a phone and the new 3T looks fab. It's only available in limited amounts, and in 128GB varieties, but it's still an excellent value phone.
The back has a similar feeling to the dark black iPhone 7.
There’s now a whole extra row of icons on the homescreen, too. As a result, you get a 4x5 grid over the previous 4x4 one, and icons are able to make much better use of the phone's screen.
Nougat's other big feature is its Multi Window support, which makes it to the OnePlus 3T – but not in the manner I was expecting. Normally, you hold the Overview button – the one that brings up your recent apps – to open up the Multi Window interface to choose which apps to open side-by-side.
The OnePlus 3T is to the OnePlus 3 what the iPhone 6S was to the iPhone 6. It looks very much the same, but there are some seriously welcome upgrades under the body.
Not a great deal has changed here. There are now two colour options, a new Gunmetal finish or Soft Gold, although if you want the new larger 128GB capacity option you’re limited to only Gunmetal. The Gunmetal option replaces the previous Graphite finish available with the OnePlus 3 and is a little darker in shade.
Outside of this, the OnePlus 3T remains 7.4mm thick and is made from a single slab of aluminium alloy that feels lovely in hand. OnePlus made a big deal about how the top of the frame curves differently from the rest of the edges. It’s not something you’re going to notice unless you go looking for it, but it’s still a nice touch.
Look to the bottom of the phone and you’ll find a neatly drilled speaker grille, a USB-C port and a headphone jack. The latter is worth drawing attention to as, despite Apple's efforts to kill the 3.5mm jack, no one seems to be in a great rush to make USB-C headphones over Lightning headphones.
Along the left edge is a three-level Alert Slider to toggle between notification profiles. You can either have them all, priority or none, just like the OnePlus 3. It’s a useful addition you don’t see often. Below this is the volume rocker, and on the opposite side the power button.
Turn the OnePlus 3T over and you’ll see a moderate camera bump from the protruding rear camera. It’s not as pronounced as on certain other phones though and OnePlus has also made improvements here by coating the sensor in sapphire glass, for an extra level of resilience.
The 3T's 5.5-inch screen is on paper identical to the OnePlus 3's. It has the same 1,920 x 1,080 resolution and uses the same Optic AMOLED technology. That’s not going to amount to the highest pixels-per-inch density in the world, but with general use it’s not something you’re going to notice.
I was also impressed with the reserved auto brightness adjustment. Too many of the phones I’ve tested have had very aggressive automatic adjustment settings that kick in even when ambient light levels haven’t changed. Brightness on the OnePlus 3T is also more than adequate for outdoor use.
The OnePlus 3T runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow overlaid with OnePlus' OxygenOS skin. OnePlus has promised an Android 7.0 Nougat update should be available before the year is out, but just wasn’t ready for launch.
You can also customise how the Home screen looks and performs. If you want, swiping up anywhere on the Home screen can open search, or swiping down from anywhere opens the notification panel so you don’t have to drag from the top. You can leave the icons exactly like stock Android or you can choose different designs, shapes or sizes. OxygenOS lets you change things only if you want, otherwise it all feels like stock Android.
The 3T is powered by a quad-core 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821: that's the same chip seen in the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. Paired with 6GB of DDR4 RAM it’s unsurprising that the OnePlus 3T feels incredibly snappy. But like the Pixel phones, the benchmarking scores don’t really tell the full story. In Geekbench 4’s single core test it managed a score of 1,853, a fraction above the Pixel XL, and in the multi-core test it managed 4,256, again just over the Pixel XL. As a frame of reference, the original OnePlus 3's Snapdragon 820 managed 1,700 and 4,019 in the Geekbench 4 tests.
Really, though, benchmark scores are beginning to lose their importance. The main thing is that the OnePlus 3T feels super responsive in day-to-day use, although it did feel like the Pixel phones had it beat in terms of touch responsiveness – again showing the shortcomings of pure benchmark numbers.
OnePlus hasn’t changed the rear-facing camera from the OnePlus 3. It’s the same Sony IMX 298 16-megapixel sensor with 1.12-micron size pixels. This is paired with an F/2.0 aperture lens that supports Phase Detect Autofocus with optical image stabilisation.
Camera performance compared to the OnePlus 3 hasn’t changed a great deal, and the OIS helps to maintain less blurry shots under low-light. Still, OIS isn’t a miracle worker and the ISO still tends to push up to noisier levels faster than some rivals, due to a smaller aperture and sensor pixel size. So while you get workable shutter speeds, low-light photographs can be noisier than I would like.
Performance from the rear camera overall is still great for the money, although not quite as amazing as when the OnePlus 3 launched at £309 (which then subsequently increased post-Brexit).
The OIS helps the camera to produce sharp shots
The original OnePlus 3 had a habit of producing smeared skin tones, whereas the OnePlus 3T looks less like the lens has been coated in vaseline and produces generally sharper results. For the narcissists out there, the selfie camera upgrade is a decent improvement.
OnePlus has upgraded the battery to 3,400mAh over the 3,000mAh in the OnePlus 3. That’s a 13% increase. This goes some way to alleviating some of my complaints about the OnePlus 3, which could sometimes struggle to make it to the end of the day.
OnePlus has its own quick charging technology, which it calls Dash Charge. This is dependent on using the supplied OnePlus Dash Charge USB wall adaptor and OnePlus USB-C cable. The reason for this is because all of the temperature regulation happens in the adaptor itself, meaning only thermal regulated current reaches the phone, so it shouldn’t overheat or have to throttle its charging. This also means that if you’re using the OnePlus 3T while it charges, the charge rate won’t need to slow down.
The cynical among us would say the OnePlus 3T merely corrects the shortcomings of the original OnePlus 3, and gives OnePlus a reason to hike the price up again. But the hardware improvements do go some way to justifying the OnePlus 3T’s creation and, in fairness, the OnePlus 3 was an already excellent template to build upon.
The OnePlus 3T remains the best Android phone you can buy in its price category with fantastic performance, great build quality and an improved battery life, but now that it’s edged towards £400 and beyond, it’s not quite as big a bargain as its predecessor.

For me, the OnePlus 3T could make it a day even under more intense usage. On a typical day I’d get to bed and there would be anywhere between 20-30% remaining. The fact that the display isn’t Quad HD no doubt helps with its battery performance. An hour of Netflix streaming with the display set to 60% brightness also only saw a drop of 9%, which is very good. Half an hour of Asphalt 8 took the battery down 7%.

A bigger change has been made to the front-facing camera, which now uses a 16-megap
l Samsung 3P8SP sensor and an F/2.0 aperture lens. It’s more than adequate for selfies or for video chatting as it's a far higher resolution than you'll find on most phones. Photos are sharper than what most front-facing cameras dole out and there’s even smile detection for automatically capturing your best you.

There’s a robust level of manual controls for those who want to get more creative with their shots, allowing you to pick your shutter speed, white balance and ISO among others. RAW support will also appeal to those who prefer to do their own post-processing, rather than leaving the image processing decisions to the phone.

What is new, though, is the introduction of electronic image stabilisation when shooting video, which allows for up to 4K at 30fps. This greatly reduces the jittery shakiness that plagued the OnePlus 3’s video.

Other OnePlus 3 camera features like the dynamic de-noise and Auto HDR return. Even with the latter engaged, which only operates under ideal scenarios, there’s no shutter lag and the Camera app responds well. OnePlus says the 6GB of RAM is actually used for the Camera app to help boost its responsiveness.

OnePlus has said it’s introduced an upgrade file system algorithm to help with app launch speed and it did feel like large games loaded that much quicker. Asphalt 8 loads up almost instantly and there’s no dropped frames while in-game. The OnePlus 3T isn’t going to leave you waiting impatiently at every turn.

As for call performance, I never encountered any problems with call quality. The microphone picked up my voice perfectly well, while I could hear callers without any issues. Using the OnePlus 3T as a loudspeaker, it delivers a surprising amount of volume, which was similarly the case with the original OnePlus 3. It's not going to deliver particularly impressive sound quality, but if you're just after sheer volume it does surprisingly well especially if you want to casually watch something on YouTube.

While it beats the Pixel XL, and it manages to just beat the Samsung Galaxy S7’s 1,848 single core score, it falls considerably short of the S7's 5,841 multi-core result. It also easily beats the more expensive Moto Z in the Antutu benchmark, where it scored 163,181. The Moto Z scored 130,550 by comparison and the OnePlus 3 138,857. Similarly, its 3DMark Slingshot score of 2,646 also wiped the floor with the Moto Z’s 2,121.

The OnePlus 3T is definitely not short of performance.

OnePlus’ ‘Shelf’ makes a return, which is accessible by swiping right on the Home screen. This houses your recent contacts, recent apps and a management centre that shows your storage and battery levels, as well as how much data you have left if you’re on a limited tariff. Again, if you don’t want to use Shelf, you can just turn it off.

One of the chief complaints when the OnePlus 3 launched was its unflattering and unnatural colour calibration. This was something that eventually got fixed through software updates, which is at least a testament to OnePlus listening to its customers.

Luckily, some of these learnings have been applied to the OnePlus 3T. Out of the box colours are a little oversaturated but the display looks
great and in truth, this is how I left the display during most of my testing.

If you want more natural, representative colours, an sRGB calibration profile is also an option, which makes the colours look considerably more muted. Another custom option lets you manually adjust the colour temperature to your liking.

From the Quick Toggle menu you can also turn on a Night mode, which knocks down the blue light part of the colour spectrum. This makes the display a little less harsh on your eyes in the dark as well as supposedly reducing the impact on your circadian rhythm.

Like the Moto Z, there’s also an Ambient Display that turns the display on in a low-power mode when notifications come in, as well as Proximity Wake that turns on the display when you wave your hand over the camera. The latter doesn’t work as well as the Moto Z’s dedicated proximity sensors, however.

The Optic AMOLED tech means black levels are superb and the display still looks super sharp, regardless of its comparably low pixels-per-inch count. Viewing angles are also excellent, with limited brightness drop-off when viewed off-centre.

The OnePlus 3T supports dual SIMs, useful if you have a personal and work number and don’t want to carry multiple devices. The second SIM slot does not double as a microSD card slot, as is the case with certain other phones, so there’s no expandable storage, just like the OnePlus 3.

But as mentioned, there is now 64GB (£399) and 128GB (£439) capacity options. The extra for 128GB isn’t a complete rip-off compared to what others have charged for extra storage, either. Otherwise, NFC makes a welcome return so you can use Android Pay.

There’s a front fingerprint sensor, which I’ve always stated is my preferred position over a rear placement. The fingerprint sensor also doubles as the Home button, flanked by capacitive Back and Recent keys that are only marked by a backlit dot, rather than their standard icons. This is because you can swap their positions in the OnePlus 3T’s settings.

The button setup is similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7's, and means you can do away with Android’s on-screen navigation buttons, freeing up more of the display. You can still turn on the on-screen navigation in the settings if you want.

Having a choice is great and the customisation options don’t end there, on the 3T you can also choose different shortcut actions for double-press and hold inputs for any of the capacitive buttons.

The fingerprint sensor feels responsive and on a par with other great fingerprint sensors, such as the Huawei P9's, when it comes to swiftness. It does fall afoul of the same pitfalls as all other fingerprint sensors I’ve used though, so wet hands will still see you resorting to more traditional unlock methods.

Key changes include a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 13% larger battery capacity and improved front-facing camera. But, with the pricing now starting at £399, do the changes justify 3T's increased upfront cost? Fortunately for OnePlus, the answer is largely yes, which is doubly good news as the OnePlus 3 is being discontinued.

On the One
lus 3T, you bring the recent apps carousel up but hold one of the open app cards and drag it to one side of the screen. Unfortunately, Multi Window isn't supported by every app at present and depending on what apps you use, can feel a little cramped.

Aside from the addition of Android 7.0, my time with the OnePlus 3T hasn’t changed much from when I first reviewed it – which is a good thing. It still feels incredibly nippy and doesn’t succumb to slow down or judder. If anything, it feels like it might be slightly snappier with Nougat.

Battery life has also held up, and I can still easily last a day without worrying about carrying a charger with me. It's hard to tell how much improvement, if any, there has been from the upgraded Doze feature in Android Nougat, however.

For me, the OnePlus 3T remains a phenomenal phone for the money, and the addition of Nougat only improves on it.



Changes are abound in the Settings menu, too. Everything's now had a lick of blue paint and you get a bit of contextual information for each settings section, such as how much duration you can expect from the battery.

New emojis have also been introduced, so if you’re sick of seeing the little ""X"" box being sent to you from iPhone users, you’ll finally be able to see those little taco or cowboy emojis you’ve been missing out on all this time.


OnePlus has also been rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to its OnePlus 3T phones over the past few weeks. I’ve had it for just over a week now, but by all accounts it’s a staggered release so don’t be surprised if you're still waiting for Nougat on your 3T.

With the update, things now look a little different to what I’d grown accustomed to having used the OnePlus 3T as my main phone since its original release.

The first thing I noticed had changed was the lockscreen notifications and the notification shade, which have both seen a design update.

In keeping with OnePlus’ light-handed touch to customising Android, it’s what you’ll see on other Nougat-powered smartphones such as Google’s Pixel devices. The changes mean you can reply from the notification shade in a more intuitive, in-line manner.

"OnePlus has always been one of those companies on the mobile scene, you just can't help but root for. At least to some degree, that is. A small company with big dreams, throwing around lofty titles, like ""the flagship killer"" and talking of a price revolution that is just around the corner.
The best part is that the tiny phone maker mostly delivered on its first viral-marketing promises. The OnePlus One kick-started a brand new and highly competitive niche market segment for value-driven devices with high-end specs. Even more impressively, it mostly managed to keep the dice rolling with the OnePlus 2 and OnePlus 3 as well.
We've been witnessing an increase in the base price for each generation of OnePlus phones. But the question whether this is due to rise in demand or due to the increased company expenses for development, sales, marketing, and after-sales support is open to interpretation.
This is where personal preferences and brand expectations kick in and star polarizing the crowd. For some, the new selfie camera, slightly faster chipset, bigger battery and a new color don't justify the extra €40, but for others - the price hike feels inevitable as OnePlus grows to the status of an established manufacturers and begins offering a higher quality service.
You are going to be reading this a lot as we examine the phone, so we might as well kick things off by saying mostly nothing has changed about the retail box. In fact, we think the only thing is a small ""T"" added to the printed logo on either side.
The signature red color accents are still prevalent throughout. There is the big red OnePlus logo on the front as well as a thin red data cable. In fact, the whole bottom half of the box is painted in bright red.
Speaking of which, one thing we are perfectly willing to hold against OnePlus is the fact that despite the Type-C connector, the OnePlus 3T still uses USB 2.0. While allowed by the standard, we would have really liked to see the OEM fix this widely-discussed aspect of the original OnePlus 3. Then again, it might be an issue of savings.
Moving on to the actual handset, there is no point beating about the bush - it is literally the same. This is no criticism, as with a metal unibody design, measuring 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4 mm and some signature curves and elements thrown here and there, it works for so many fans already.
The only real outward change is a new color. OnePlus decided to replace the Graphite finish with a darker one, it is calling Gunmetal. It comes down to personal taste, but we think it looks even better on metal. The other color option remains Soft Gold. Besides the metal back, it also swaps the black front with a white one.
Just like its sibling, the OnePlus 3T is a gorgeous device. It is molded out of a single piece of space-grade aluminum, which combines strength with elegance and is just so great to the touch. It measures only 7.4mm in depth and tips the scale at 158 grams. We can't fail to mention that the bigger battery pack not only came at no expense in terms of volume, but weight as well. That is some advanced battery magic, if we ever saw some.
The body of the handset is designed with smooth, rounded shapes and some sharp well defined edges, it is both easy to handle and elegant. Instead of trying to rebel against the ""slab"" design that has been choking the smartphone industry for some time now, through often questionable gimmicks like detachable modules, OnePlus decide to embrace it a good while back. Since then, the OEM has only been working to refine it and the results show.
Just like the OnePlus 3, the only little beef we have with the ""T"" variant and we doubt it is universally shared is the camera bump. It sticks out quite a bit, which is a natural side-effect of having a 7.35mm body. Besides the subjective aesthetics of the phone, when left on a flat surface, the main concern with this is scratches to the camera lens.
The front of the OnePlus 3T is also about as clean as it can be. When the display is off it blends in with the surrounding almost perfectly. Side-bezels around the 5.5-inch panel are so thin at just 0.755mm, that the picture appears to almost float above the base. So, the wow factor is still there despite the lack of a curved display.
Despite its clean front panel, the OnePlus 3T actually leaves quite a few controls at the user's disposal, but they are hidden away quite well. In the typical company fashion, users are offered a full range of navigation customization options, including the choice between on-screen controls and the capacitive touch buttons. The latter are practically invisible when not lit and otherwise show up as single white dots. They can also be rotated on a software level to match your preferred Back and Menu key placement.
On the left side of the OnePlus 3T we find a standard volume rocker, with the same metal finish as the rest of the unit. Right above it, however, is a rather uncommon control that you don't see that often in the Android realm. It is the Alert Slider, which can quickly toggle between the three basic ring states - normal ringing mode, do not disturb and silent. The feature is also customizable and is something fans should already be familiar with. Although, previously, the button did control Notifications, rather than ringer.
Moving on to the right of the unit, we see the power button, done in exactly the same fashion as the volume rocker. We wish OnePlus would move it slightly in one or the other direction, so it is not directly opposing the volume rocker. But, that is nitpicking.
To wrap our tour up, the top of the OnePlus 3T is absolutely empty, there is not even a secondary mic, which is on the back.
The bottom, on the other hand, is quite busy. Here we find the USB Type-C connector, which, sadly, only offers a USB 2.0 connection. We also have a single speaker grille, the main microphone and next to it, the 3.5mm jack.
This is yet another department, which OnePlus approached with the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" mentality and thankfully so. A 5.5-inch panel still seems to be right in the sweet spot for many mobile users - especially on the Asian markets.
The AMOLED panel in question comes courtesy of Samsung and is specially made for the OnePlus, hence the Optic AMOLED moniker. Still, it looks just as gorgeous as any other Samsung Super AMOLED panel, and unless you place it next to a QHD phone, the difference between the two is hardly noticeable. Sure, the diamond pentile pixel arrangement isn't the best possible choice, but the screen more than makes up for that with its great contrast.
Along with the choice of screen resolution, color accuracy was another big point over which the OnePlus 3 was criticized. Punchy AMOLED colors are somewhat more appealing to a broader customer audience, which was the reasoning. However, OnePlus quickly found a way to offer a more accurate color rendering mode - called sRGB.
The OnePlus 3T is a Dual-SIM device, just like its sibling and predecessor. It takes two nano SIM cards, and neither of the SIM slots is a hybrid one, and it won't take a microSD. However, we are a lot more willing to let it slide this time around since there is a 128GB version.
Changing gears quickly, as if to wash away the minor USB disappointment, the 3,400 mAh battery in the OnePlus 3T is quite the engineering feat. The most impressive thing about it is that the extra battery capacity doesn't come at the expense of neither added weight nor volume.
The OnePlus 3T managed to clock in a really impressive 83 hours of endurance rating. This is even more impressive when we consider what we have seen from previous OnePlus phones - 66 hours on the OnePlus 3, 61 hours total on the OnePlus 2 and exactly 66 hours on the original OnePlus One as well. This is a solid achievement by the OnePlus 3, as it does have a smaller battery than its predecessors. However, the OnePlus 3T makes really good use of the extra 400 mAh as well. Standby times saw the biggest improvements, while things like web browsing, video playback and 3G talk time, came out just as optimized as in previous OnePlus software iterations.
The original OnePlus One came running on CyanogenMod but in the end OnePlus had to come up with an original launcher and drop the Cyanogen entirely. In hindsight, this was probably a nail in the now struggling custom ROM's coffin. But, on the flip side, at least the move played out well for OnePlus.
Apart from these few useful software features, sprinkled here and there, Oxygen aims to bring a nearly vanilla Android experience. Most of the Android interface is intact - it's the Material design and icons we first met in Android Lollipop. All stock Android fans will be pleased to find out OnePlus touched almost nothing as far as homescreens and menu visuals are concerned.
While the screen is still off, there are also quite a few gestures to enjoy. There is the popular double-tap to wake and you can also do some drawing to open certain apps. For instance, draw O for the camera, draw V to toggle the flashlight on/off, or draw < > for previous/next track. Current OnePlus users will already be familiar with these and pleased to see they are untouched. Beyond that, there is also flip to mute and a three finger swipe down gesture to capture a screenshot.
Moving on to the actual lockscreen itself - it is the usual affair. Missed notifications show up here. Swiping left or right will fire up the dialer or the camera.
The Oxygen launcher is incredibly clean and very close to vanilla Android indeed. There are, however, a few notable tweaks. For instance, the launcher has a feature called Shelf, which takes the form of your leftmost homescreen. Here you can see the weather, your most used apps, and frequent contacts. You can also add widgets and change the header image. When you first setup the phone it asks if you want to use Shelf. You can also disable or enable it later.
Shelf has now morphed in style quite a bit. There are a few less-than-intuitive controls here worth mentioning. For instance, the only way to remove a widget once added is to swipe it away to the right. In OnePlus's defense, there are no other panes to the left of Shelf for you to swipe to, but it still feels like a duplicated control. Plus, there is no indication for the action.
The notification shade is standard as well. You can lower it with a single swipe from anywhere in the UI and an additional one will reveal the quick toggles. You can also use two fingers to bring down the whole thing in a single swipe. As for the toggles, they include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Night Mode, Airplane mode, screen auto-rotate, flashlight, location on/off and a few others. These can all be rearranged and hidden easily. Of course, you can also adjust the brightness of the screen and go into the settings menu.
The app switcher has a neat card interface that allows you to select the app you need by swiping up or down. You can close apps by swiping left or right, or by hitting the dedicated button on the top right corner of each card. Google Chrome, which is the default browser, no longer presents each tab as a view in this interface, but it can still be enabled in Chrome settings. The bottom of the tab switcher now has a single button to clean the recent apps stack and potentially even more.
Select Deep clear and they will be no more. However, this does also mean that many messengers and other real-time apps will likely stop functioning correctly until relaunched manually. That being said, OnePlus is off to a great start with the added feature and all it needs now is a whitelist.
OnePlus didn't leave out its iconic three way mode slider either. As already mentioned, it now toggles between three Alert modes - silent, do not disturb and ring. Each mode actually has some additional configuration that can be applied. For Ring, there is currently only a vibration toggle. But if you go under Do not disturb, you can really fine-tune who and what can and can't get to you while in the mode.
Last, but not least, the launcher also has quite a few style customization options. There is the simple Dark mode toggle, that should probably be your fist choice, since AMOLED power consumption decreases greatly, the darker the UI gets. There are also other trivial options, like wallpapers. But also a few less than standard ones, like changing the style of the Google Search widget, tinkering with the icon size or even selecting a different icon pack.
Of course, if the default Oxygen launcher still doesn't quench you thirst for customization, you can always just download and set-up a launcher of your choice. The thing you can't just go in and change is the OnePlus 3T's hardware and how it performs. We already know it is more than powerful enough to handle any load, since that is the case with its vanilla sibling as well. However, there are a few hidden details that might make a difference in the user experience after all. Follow along in the next section for our two cents on that.
As already mentioned, OnePlus focused its efforts on upgrading the internals of the handset. Some aspects of this hardware refresh are a little bit more visible than others, like the new 128GB storage option or the higher megapixel front camera. The new Snapdragon 821 chipset is a little bit harder to distinguish from its Snapdragon 820 sibling at first glance. However, it does constitute a notable upgrade all around.
Firstly, there is the matter of the higher max clock rate of two of the Kryo cores inside. Admittedly, this probably won't have groundbreaking effect on real-world performance. But in a benchmark scenario, where the CPU is being pushed to the limit, the difference definitely shows.
Looking at GeekBench, we can clearly see the OnePlus 3T hold its own and easily surpass its OnePlus 3 sibling. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Huawei Mate 8 seem to be enjoying better multi-core optimization with their respective custom chipset solutions. However, as far as Snapdragon 820 devices go, we can clearly see the OnePlus 3 blows away contenders like the Qualcomm-powered Galaxy S7 and the Xiaomi Mi 5. The OnePlus 3T is even better at it.
Sure, Huawei's silicon appears to be acing multi-core performance tests along with some rare MediaTek chipsets such as the Helio X25. However, within the popular Qualcomm realm, nothing can currently compete with the raw power of the Snapdragon 821.
Now, there are actually quite a few aspects at play here. Besides the CPU clock speed boost, the MSM8996 Snapdragon 821 also operates its Adreno 530 GPU at a higher frequency. More on that a little bit later. The RAM interface frequency and maximum bandwidth has also been increased from 1333 MHz or 21.3GB/s to 1866 MHz or 29.8 GB/s. However, we have no real indications that OnePlus changed the 6GB LPDDR4 chips, powering the handset. They are most-likely identical to the ones in the OnePlus 3.
However, that being said, it is also important to note that this should not be written off as an advantage of the refreshed model. OnePlus has promised to bring the F2FS file system to the older device as well, once Nougat hits and both devices end up on the same software and update path. This should effectively shrink the storage performance difference between the pair. In fact, if you are currently using a OnePlus 3 unit and are feeling adventurous, you can pick up the latest community build of Oxygen OS and experience the performance difference for yourself.
Even the highly-demanding OpenGL ES 3.1 Car benchmark was rendered at a respectable 20 frames by the OnePlus 3T. That is almost playable and quite an achievement, considering not long ago, handsets barely managed single-digit scores in the benchmark.
Not much has changed in regard to the core set of apps within Oxygen OS since its last major update. Current OnePlus owners, as well as most stock Android fans will feel right at home.
The phone app comes with a tabbed interface for speed dial, recent calls and all contacts. The dialer is invoked by taping on its dedicated key and supports smart dialing.
Messaging is pretty much as straightforward an affair as on every other droid out there. The generic Email app is being decommissioned in favor of the Gmail app. If you tap on its icon, it will tell you the Gmail app is the client that will handle all your emails from now on.
As expected, the default Google keyboard is on board as well. It offers two sleek-looking skins - Material Dark and Material Light. It is now smart enough and supports things like Gesture typing, but if you would rather go with a third party for this feature, SwiftKey is also on board by default.
One of the Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.
OnePlus has also thrown in a Weather app this time around. It features a very minimalistic interface, complete with animations and a parallax effect. All the data comes from AccuWeather. The app is hardly a resource hog by any measure, but since it is not there to serve a vital function, like the rest of the small OnePlus package, you can always elect to uninstall it.
Like we were saying, OnePlus has opted to include the standard Google app suite in the handset, but also hasn't skipped on developing a few basic apps itself. The Gallery app is one of them. You can just as easily browse your photos and videos through Google Photos or even the Files app, but Gallery also acts as a built-in video player.
Google Photos can handle some basic video playback as well and between the two, you can expect decent support, including Xvid, DivX, H.263, H.264 AVC (MKV files), and MPEG-4. However, if you want more versatility, or even relatively simple features, like subtitle support, look for a third-party solution.
As for music playback, again there are two options. The default Oxygen OS Music app is rather basic, but it does offer a few sorting options, as well as a few more advanced things like tags and favorites.
However, Google Play Music is still loaded on by default and it is a good thing too. It has come a long way and even if you don't intend to subscribe to Google's streaming service, it still offers bells and whistles like album art, powerful searching algorithms and also the neat ability to upload your own tracks to the cloud and stream them for free.
When plugged into an active external amplifier, the OnePlus 3T posted excellent scores top to bottom and garnished them with very high volume levels. A performance easily among the best on the market here.
On paper, the OnePlus 3T main camera is yet another department, which OnePlus decided to carry over from the vanilla sibling. This is a good thing too since both phones offer a solid camera experience.
The camera utilizes the same Sony IMX298 sensor, which is not Sony's cutting-edge offer but is still good enough to power some other excellent flagship cameras, like the Xiaomi Mi 5 and the Huawei Mate 8. The very same sensor is also found in the Oppo R9 and R9 Plus, the ZTE Nubia Z11 family as well as the Vivo Xplay 5 and the XPlay 5 Elite.
Other than that, you have the most important toggles close at hand - flash, HDR and Oxygen OS's HQ mode in stills and only the LED control under video. The quick setting button next to the shutter release holds a few extra things, like aspect or video resolution control, the self-timer and the grid.
There are also quite a few modes for you to experiment with. Besides the usual Photo and Video, there is also Panorama for stills, Time-lapse and Slow motion for video. Then there is the powerful Manual mode. It offers granular control over ISO, contrast, shutter speed and focus and it works really well. We particularly like the fact that a convenient auto setting is still left in all the sliders.
Regarding image quality, the OnePlus 3T may have the same camera hardware as the OnePlus 3 but it comes with a new factory tuning. In-camera sharpening is more prominent now. Noise reduction is dialed back, and there is noticeable noise from as low as ISO 100. The level of detail is higher than the OnePlus 3 in most scenarios and especially in high ISO scenarios. Edge-to-edge sharpness and contrast are superior to the OnePlus 3. The result is impressively sharp and pleasant looking images and we really can't ask for more out of a €440 handset.
Auto HDR worked great during our testing and managed to kick in just in time. The processing itself is also very mature, definitely not too excessive. We also appreciate the on-screen notification whenever Auto HDR kicks in. This way you are always clear exactly what the camera app is doing.
And if you happen to fancy a little bit of extra processing, the OnePlus 3T is more than happy to deliver upon request. The HQ toggle in the camera app does just that - it enables some additional enhancement algorithms that try to recover some of the finer detail that might have gone missing.
In broad daylight the effect of the HQ mode is perhaps too subtle to make a difference. However, in low light conditions, it works amazingly well. You can think of it as a per-request extra processing mode. When turned on it tries to remove as much of the noise it can and then recover the detail.
As previously mentioned, the new 16MP front-facing camera is a great performer. It produces some impressive stills. The 1080p video is also great for most conversational or even vlogging purposes. Capturing stills is a bit on the slow side, but it never actually got on our nerves.
It hardly comes as a surprise that the powerful Snapdragon 821 has plenty of horsepower to deliver 4K video recording. The video recording UI is just as simple as its photo counterpart. You don't really get a whole lot of options, besides a grid and resolution controls.
The vanilla OnePlus 3 does quite alright with 4K capture as it is, but something appears to have changed behind the scenes on the OnePlus 3T.
1080p naturally isn't as impressive as 4K capture. There is a bitrate improvement compared to the original OnePlus 3 in this area as well, but the end result can still benefit from some extra detail. One nuisance that we noted back in the OnePlus 3 review was the significant mismatch between the viewfinder and the actual framing in 1080p.
You can also download the 4K@30fps (10s, 68MB) and the 1080p video (10s, 25MB) and 1080p @ 60 fps video (10s, 49MB) samples taken straight off the OnePlus 3T.
OnePlus has really come a long way since 2014. Only a few years ago, the manufacturer was busy riling up people, shouting bold claims like ""the flagship killer"" and desperately trying to rise from obscurity through any guerilla marketing stunt available. And somehow, it all eventually clicked, and today, the company's smartphones are eagerly anticipated and widely discussed.
The kid is all grown up now and although the ""never settle"" mentality is still alive and well, the business is now way past handing out invitations and carefully micro-managing production and shipping iterations. The up-sizing is a fact and with it the new market realities. But with everything said and done, we aren't at all willing to write off the OnePlus 3T as nothing more than a needless rehash to pave the way for the infamous price hike.

On the contrary. After spending quite a lot of time with the handset, the little things definitely start to shine through. OnePlus has somehow made what was already a great device an even better one and the €40 price premium is well justified in our book.Even after the price readjustment, the OnePlus 3T price to performance ratio is still hard to beat. The original OnePlus One disrupted the market when it came out, and the mobile scene has arguably been better for it ever since. As a result, there is some strong competition in the €400-450 price range. Better yet, it is not at all unreasonable to expect cutting-edge specs in this price point.

The first contender that comes to mind is the ZTE Axon 7. Value-wise, it definitely doesn't lack behind the OnePlus 3T. It is all metal, with a 5.5-inch, QHD, AMOLED panel, Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You do, however, get a microSD card slot with this one and the build-in powerful stereo speakers offer one of the best audio experiences currently on the market. However, if you go for the ZTE, you will be sacrificing some of the perceivable brand coolness, along with a fair bit of battery capacity and a truly decluttered software experience. Price-wise, there is practically no difference.

Speaking of ZTE, we can't fail to mention the Nubia Z11 either. The pricing is right and so are the internals - Snapdragon 820, 4GB to 6GB of RAM and 64GB to 128GB of storage. The 1080p LCD panel is somewhat of a downgrade, but, overall, it is definitely a device worth considering.
Just like the OnePlus 3, the updated version has OIS as well. Sadly, the system is still just as poorly implemented. In fact, this is probably the camera's biggest weakness. The OnePlus 3T can't really handle shaking all that well.

One thing that OnePlus did implement with the OnePlus 3T is a 60 fps capture mode in 1080p. It works pretty well and maintains a fluid frame rate, just like the regular 30fps mode. Also, current OnePlus 3 users can expect to see it as well in an OTA. It is just one of the many OnePlus 3T features that will trickle down to the vanilla sibling.

We still believe firmly that this is a relatively small software error that shouldn't take long to patch. However, it is still in place on the OnePlus 3T.

For one, the videos come out with a whopping 55 Mbps bit rate, compared to 42 Mbps on the OnePlus 3. Audio has remained the same - 2 channels at 96 Kbps and 48KHz. The amount of resolved detail in the 4K videos is high, but not the best we've seen. The colors are accurate, the contrast is high, while the dynamic range is slightly above the average. The framerate is smooth and consistent at 30fps. Focus-hunting is kept at a minimum during recording. There is some shaking to note on some of the samples, but that is entirely due to the strong wind.

Panorama mode works great with practically no trace of stitching, misalignment or other artifacts.

The camera offers consistent performance and most of the time it just worked. We rarely found ourselves having to re-shoot a specific scene. Most often than not, we didn't need to adjust anything and the Auto mode worked just fine for most occasions.

Other more obscure settings such as geotagging, preferred storage and the shutter sound are all hidden away in the settings menu. There is even RAW support that saves files alongside the compressed ones, so the camera is undoubtedly full-featured.

The 16MP camera has a 1.12 µm pixel size and an aperture of f/2.0. The sensor measures 1/2.8"". It is also OIS-enabled and has a single LED flash at its disposal.

As for the selfie camera, OnePlus has decided to offer an upgrade. The simple 8MP camera in the OnePlus 3 has been swapped for a 16MP one in the OnePlus 3T. The new snapper has a f/2.0 aperture, but don't expect anything too fancy in terms of performance. The snapper is still fixed-focus, and there is no front-facing flash. Then again, OnePlus has never really advertised a stellar selfie experience.

But let's start by telling you more about the camera UI. The default camera app is based on the stock Android solution and is about as straightforward and streamlined as it gets. On the surface, it even looks to be missing some features, and there are a couple of things we would have liked to see, like still resolution control and perhaps some filters. However, those do seem to be the only absent pieces.

That being said, however, mobile camera capabilities have come a long way, especially in the last few months, so what we are trying to say is that perhaps the camera of the OnePlus 3T is not competitive today as it was on the OnePlus 3.

It is still a solid snapper by any means and it performs consistently and reliably under all conditions. It seldom requires more than a single attempt to capture the desired shot.

Adding in a pair of headphones causes moderate damage to stereo quality and introduces some extra distortion. The overall output is still very good in terms of clarity but its volume also dropped from excellent to merely good so it's not longer an among the best.

And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.

The photo app also gives you a number of options. You can share stills, set them as wallpaper or contact photos, or edit them. The built-in Photos editor is incredibly powerful too.

OnePlus has opted to use most of the Google app suite on the OnePlus 3, but there are a few exceptions, like the dedicated File app, Gallery and Music player. The usual organizing tools are present as well - there is the massively capable Google Calendar, a neat Calculator, and Clock (alarms, world clock, timer, stopwatch). A Recorder app was also thrown in the mix.

OnePlus has stuck to its typical design approach and like its sibling, the OnePlus 3T also has a single loudspeaker on the bottom. Just like it, however, the updated version isn't particularly loud. It only scored a ""Good"" mark in our proprietary test.

The contacts manager features a tabbed interface, which displays all contacts and the favorites. You can sync with multiple accounts including Google and Exchange. A button to add a new contact is constantly present in the bottom right corner - you can choose which account to sync the new addition with.

Basemark X and Basemark ES 3.1 paint a very similar picture as well.

Moving on to graphics, it is hardly surprising to see that the Adreno 530 copes a lot better when tasked to only push pixels in 1080p resolution, as opposed to QHD. This has always been a polarizing aspect on the OnePlus line, especially in 2016. However, like we already mentioned, we stand firm behind our belief that 1080p is perfectly sharp on a 5.5-inch panel and the power-efficiency and performance benefits are undeniable.

Furthermore, the Adreno 530 inside the Snapdragon 821 is now clocked at 653 Mhz, compared to the 510 MHz, inside the older Snapdragon 820. This shines through in the benchmark runs as well.

Something that did definitely change, however, is the device's default file system. Now, this is a harder subject to investigate, but a few fellow tech reviewers have managed to determine that the two OnePlus 3 models use the same snappy UFS 2.0 NAND storage chips. However, whereas the vanilla OnePlus 3 still uses EXT4 as a file system, on the OnePlus 3T, F2FS is now the standard.

The latter has been making the rounds in various custom ROM communities, including the OnePlus one, going as far back as the original OnePlus One handset. It appears the real-world benefits from using the more efficient file system are tangible. Cold-starting many demanding apps is a few seconds quicker on the OnePlus 3T, over its sibling on these grounds alone.

But, chances are, most users aren't going to be running a lot of complex mathematical computations on their new phone. Luckily, performance boosts in the OnePlus 3T extend beyond simple number-crunching power to deliver a more fluent and pleasant experience as a whole.

A quick look at the all-round AnTuTu benchmark, clearly shows the OnePlus 3T is ahead of the pack. Also, something as simple as a real-life application launch time test next to the older OnePlus 3 or many other contemporary Android devices, often shows a significant improvement (granted, not scientifically measured).

OnePlus has always put great emphasis on customizability and like previous models, it is still woven right into the device from hardware, all the way to software. We already mentioned that Oxygen OS lets you easily chose between using the phone's capacitive keys or on-screen controls for navigation. Not only that, but you can also remap and rearrange said controls respectively - the Menu and App Switcher keys can be reversed, plus you can assign them custom actions upon double-tap and hold.

Hidden away in the advanced settings menu, along with a few other things, like the scheduled power on and off features (great to have, by the way), is a new menu that lets you choose how your recent apps get cleaned. The default mode does just what you would expect on any other Android device - clear the stack of recent foreground apps. Selecting deep clear goes after background services as well.

This is a truly great power-user feature to have, since the only traditional way to see the background services running on your device is through the Developer menu. And, believe it or not, a lot of your favorite apps tend to have a quite relaxed attitude towards what services and how many of them they can leave hanging back there hours on end. Naturally, this eats through your resources, battery and potentially data plan behind the scenes.

The vertical space within Shelf also seems to be limited. This is not bad in itself, but the way you increase said space is to click and hold the last widget until a very odd slider-looking thing appears on screen. You then have to slide said control left or right for less or more room. Quite unintuitive. Hopefully, these kicks get worked out soon.



But, lets dial things back a bit. Even before you unlock the device, there are a few experiences to be had. First off, there is the superb fingerprint reader, we already talked about. It is nothing short of excellent in both speed and accuracy and the only grudge we see some people having with it is the fact that it is not implemented inside an actual button.

Since fingerprint readers are now part of the core Android code, that is one thing less OnePlus has to worry about in terms of custom implementations. The handset relies on the standard manager interface to get the biometric security all set-up.

This is how the Oxygen OS was born and although the ambitious ROM has come a long way now that it is on version 3.5.3, little has changed on the surface and most improvements are behind the scenes. The Oxygen OS community is actually among the most active out there and the team is always hard at work developing what are typically pretty useful features. In fact, that's one thing OnePlus has become famous for, so much so that a few of said custom features have already made their way into the core Android OS.

It is also important to note that OnePlus plans to bring the regular OnePlus 3 up to speed with all the new software features and even, eventually, merge the two device's software branches. Currently, the OnePlus 3 is running OxygenOS 3.2.8 OTA, which is still a separate branch and is busy catching up with features. For instance, the 1080p 60fps video recording mode has already trickled down. The aforementioned merge is said to happen by the end of the year, or early next year, as Oxygen OS gets updated to Nougat. From that point on, both devices will likely get updated on same schedule.

As for charging, there is the excellent Dash technology. We already touched upon it briefly, and the hype really is justified. If you use the Dash charger and cable included in the box, you can quickly pump up to 20W of power into the OnePlus 3T.

The technology also rules out overheating, which one could naturally expect with such a current going in the phone. On the technical side of things, this is achieved through a clever segmentation system, which allows the sub-parts of the battery to be charged independently in parallel (Oppo's VOOC charging).

The Dash system is so efficient that it practically eliminated the need for overnight charging while we tested the device. 30 minutes on the charger consistently got us from a dead battery up to 60%. Not only that but 60% in 30 minutes was valid both for the OnePlus 3 and the new ""T"" variant, despite the difference in battery capacity.

There is LTE on board as well. It comes courtesy of Qualcomm's current flagship chip, the Snapdragon 821, with Cat.6 speeds of up to 300 Mbps downstream and a rich combination of HSPDA and LTE bands, making the OnePlus 3T a truly global device.

There's a full set of a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi standards on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, Wi-Fi Direct, hotspot and DLNA media sharing on supported TVs and PCs. There is also Bluetooth 4.2 added to the mix.

The USB Type-C connector is quickly becoming the industry standard and OnePlus was quite ahead of the curve in this department, adopting it as far back as the OnePlus 2. However, we still can't get over the fact that there is a USB 2.0 controller, standing behind this modern connector.

With the OnePlus 3T the option is more easily accessible. It does a great job of delivering accurate colors, with an average deltaE as low as 2.8 and a maximum of 5.5. The image does look a bit bland in this mode, so if the punchy screen is what you are after, then the default mode can deliver plenty of that.

What we will touch upon instead is the VR argument. Yes, 1080p is not ideal for virtual reality, and yes, OnePlus does have a VR headset, of sorts - the Loop VR Headset. However, the company has made it clear that from its standpoint, strapping a phone to your forehead is more of a gimmick than a viable approach to VR in its current form, and as such is not considered a priority. We agree, these are some rather mixed messages they are sending, but then again, the VR headset in question is merely a fancy Google Cardboard-style viewer, so the whole thing is more for show and marketing than anything else.

Anyway, back to the Optic AMOLED panel. It offers a quite respectable 401ppi, and at 439 nits at full blast, it is bright enough for most scenarios. That is even a few nits brighter than the 433nits, which we managed to register on the original OnePlus 3. Contrast is naturally great, given the AMOLED technology and the perfectly deep blacks associated with it.

As for the choice of 1080p resolution, at the risk of fueling the seemingly endless flame war on the matter, we still firmly believe that you don't need more pixels. Plus, there is the battery life benefit of using the lower screen resolution, and with OpenGL ES 3.1 gaming becoming even more advanced in graphics, the GPU will appreciate the extra breathing room. Just stick around for the graphics benchmarks if you don't believe us.



Then there is the SIM tray. The OnePlus 3T is a Dual-SIM device, so the tray actually takes two nano cards. Sadly, neither of the slots would take a microSD card and it is sad to see OnePlus skimping on expandable storage altogether. Throwing it in would have definitely added some value over the OnePlus 3. But then again, there is a new 128GB storage option on offer this time around.

As for the Home key, just like on the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 2 before it, it is not really a button. It is a fingerprint reader that also recognizes a tap gesture. Performance-wise, it can only be described as blazing fast. The input is also always-on and offers a nice little vibration feedback from the phone, to compensate for the lack of tactile feedback.

OnePlus has managed to address this as well with the OnePlus 3T. Instead of simple glass, like on the OnePlus 3, the finish is now sapphire. This might be a small detail, but one that you will come to appreciate after using the handset regularly for a bit.

While we are on the topic, the back of the unit is very clean. It has the camera bump in question and a single LED flash below it. The only other thing there is the neatly engraved OnePlus logo and a couple of antenna lines, the top of which hides a secondary noise-canceling mic.

DASH is actually a custom version of Oppo's VOOC technology, which we still believe is the industry leader when it comes to fast charging. OnePlus advertises a zero to 60% charge of the 3400mAh battery in just 30 minutes and to our surprise, we actually managed to get pretty close to those numbers.

That being said, many might be interested in picking up the OnePlus car Dash charger. It is currently going for around EUR 30 on the official store.

OnePlus also throws in a DASH charger, rated at 4A at 5V and the compatible DASH cable. Both are required to get the fast charging system going. This is the case, since, the cable itself uses a non-standard scheme for some of the pins. Currently, most custom charging solutions rely on some custom pinout or other sort of trickery, while generally maintaining compatibility with standards as well, so there is no room for scolding OnePlus on this point alone. The whole industry needs to work this out, especially if we are going to safely transition to the new Type-C connector standard.

The rectangular, two piece package still has that signature OnePlus look. In a way, it is very clean and streamlined, like what you would expect form Apple or Xiaomi, with lots of white and uniform surfaces. Most are soft-touch as well for extra refinement.

If you are okay with what the original OnePlus 3 offers, then make sure you get one now as this model will only be available while the current supplies last.

For the rest of you, who are tempted by the latest devices to come out of the innovative Chinese manufacturer, join us as we try and quantify the upgrades value of the new product from a practical perspective.

If it's the latter reason, we can't find any fault with OnePlus readjusting for the increased scale of their business, but we hope that doesn't mean the end of the ""Never settle"" mentality.

Thankfully, despite the turbulent growth, OnePlus hasn't lost its touch. The OnePlus 3T is still a great device with fantastic value. We just have our doubts about whether the upgrades are worth the price premium over the no.

The OnePlus 3T is still an amazing value device that embodies the original company spirit and the ""never settle"" attitude.

"OnePlus is a company that doesn’t much like its reputation in the smartphone business as a plucky upstart. Yet that’s what it is, competing as it must with the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google for the crown of best smartphone in the world. See also: Best phones 2017.
Following the extremely limited Collette edition of the OnePlus 3T (just 250 units), the company has announced the Midnight Black version of the 3T. This is still a 'limited release' but doesn't require you to gueue up in Paris to purchase it.
The OnePlus 3T is on sale SIM-free and unlocked directly from OnePlus. Click here to view it – it’ll cost you £399 for the 64GB version and just £40 more for the £439 128GB version, which is now available to preorder. Both are currently available in the Gunmetal colour, which is slightly darker than the Graphite version of the OnePlus 3. 
Even the ‘s’ iterations of iPhones have an ‘s’ stamped on the back, but in this case there is absolutely no design change from the OnePlus 3 to the OnePlus 3T. The only change is in the darker colour option, the grey of which on the rear is a tad darker than the old model. The forthcoming Soft Gold option is exactly the same, and visually indistinguishable from its five month old brother.
This reinforces that OnePlus sees the 3T as a small tweak for the line, hoping as it does to not frustrate loyal fans that shelled out for a 3. The 3T happily retains an outstanding design, with build quality to rival any premium smartphone maker in the land. It does what Apple has still failed to do and made a 5.5in screen phone slim, svelte and usable with one hand (just).
At the launch event for the OnePlus 3T, co-founder Carl Pei explained that the company is always striving to do better; he used Apple’s design as a benchmark and the phone is one of the best looking handsets on the market, rivalling the matte black iPhone 7 Plus in the looks department, which is no mean feat. It does however remain slightly slippy, and is a phone that could be destroyed with one drop onto the pavement. We recommend one of OnePlus’ subtle but grippy cases that fit both this and the older OnePlus 3.
Much of the 3T's spec sheet remains the same as its predecessor but there are also some important upgrades. Let's take a look.
Despite initial rumours, the OnePlus 3T has exactly the same display as the OnePlus 3. It’s a 5.5in Optic AMOLED with Full HD (1920x1080) resolution and 401ppi. By its own admission, OnePlus continues to ship a screen that recreates colours more vibrantly than most, but with the Oxygen OS skin of Android that it runs this feels right; the handset and feel of the software that the screen runs is right at home with the popping colours and bright whites.
There’s the option to calibrate the colours to your tastes though, and this is one example of the granularity of Android helping the OnePlus 3T more than most become a truly personal device.
The OnePlus 3T’s upgrades are mostly all internal, and while they’re all welcome, it took a fair few days of use to see why it’s come to be. We’ve used the OnePlus 3 for a few months, so can draw decent comparisons – straight off, you need not upgrade for fear of missing out on processor power, speed or battery life if you own the older model.
The OnePlus 3T is available with 64GB of internal storage, but bear in mind there’s no SD card slot. The fact you only need to spend £30 more to get an impressive 128GB shows you that Apple charging £100 more for that jump in storage for the iPhone 7 is unnecessarily high. For most, spending that extra money will be well worth it.
The fingerprint scanner is on the front bottom face of the device, which is still where these sensors work best, despite Sony trying the side and Huawei and others the back. The button is non-moving and gives the perfect level of feedback when unlocking the device or using a compatible app like Android Pay to verify your identity. Unlike the iPhone 7, it doesn’t feel like the whole phone is clicking down – it’s way better here.
The non-removable battery clocks in at 3,400mAh, a step up from the 3,000 of the OnePlus 3. The internals are exactly the same dimensions but the battery is denser, hence the increase. In general use the phone will last a full working day which is about average. We left the house most days at 8am with 100%, and by the time we rolled in from work at about 6.30pm the OnePlus 3T had about 30% left in the tank.
On one particularly busy Google Maps day out in Barcelona even after 12 hours on the go the battery was sitting at 15%, and that was with the phone used to navigate, take photos and video and more besides. Obviously it depends what you’re doing on the device, but for all but the most intensive users, the OnePlus 3T will last the whole day no questions asked and lighter users should be able to get a decent chunk into a second day with the 3T.
The slim casing of the 3T means the camera protrudes slightly. This is an acceptable pay-off for what is an excellent sensor: a 16Mp lens with f/2.0 aperture and an LED flash. It’s also capable of shooting video at 4K resolution or 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. We used the camera extensively in Barcelona, and the results were very impressive.
The front-facing 16Mp camera is an upgrade on the 8Mp of the OnePlus 3, and is one of the highest resolution selfie cameras on the market, matching as it does the megapixel count of the rear one. It’s an impressive upgrade, but one that only the most ardent of selfie fans will notice. However, it did improve the quality of video calling considerably, and will benefit those into Snapchat stories and similar services.
Refreshingly the software update that the OnePlus 3T ships with changes the user experience in all the right ways to represent a clean, intuitive and pleasant to use Android version that is every bit as good as Google’s own version. By basing its Android skin Oxygen OS closely to stock Android Marshmallow 6.0, OnePlus has been able to make small tweaks that don’t completely change the way we used the phone, but enough to notice positive improvements day to day.
The OnePlus 3T cleverly combines a physical slider with profile changes to quickly switch between modes. Here, the three-position switch goes between Silent, Do Not Disturb and Ring. These are customisable and are useful for putting your phone into a quieter mode for meetings or when you go to bed for example. This is different to how the slider worked on the OnePlus 3, where it went between Silent, Priority Notifications and All Notifications. The functions are basically the same, but again have some software tweaks within the settings menu.
So it’s crunch time; you bought a OnePlus 3 in June and five months later, do you upgrade? Well, no, you shouldn’t in our opinion. The OnePlus 3T may have, on paper, a better processor, bigger battery and better selfie camera but if you own the 3, it isn’t worth spending another £400 for those features. If you can sell on your old device for a good price then perhaps you’d be tempted, but if the company has done the 3T this fast, it surely can’t be that much longer until we see a OnePlus 4.
This is a trickier question, and one that ran with a time limit – OnePlus has ceased production, so once they’re gone, they’re gone and the 3T will be the only phone the company still sells. On the day the 3T sent on sale in Europe, the OnePlus 3 was completely sold out on the company's website. 
At the time of writing however the OnePlus 3 was still available on contract from O2. We'd wager this is the last way in the UK to get the old model brand new - otherwise, look to eBay.
At the RRP, if you only need 64GB and want to save £70, the OnePlus 3 remains an outstanding piece of hardware that will be more than adequate at the high end of the market for at least another year and a half. That £70 could buy you OnePlus’ new Bullets earphones, an official case and a spare Dash Charge Bundle with change to spare. 
However, if you want 128GB on board storage, you’ll have to go for the OnePlus 3T, setting you back £439. It’s also the best way to get hold of the Soft Gold colour if you prefer – the OnePlus 3 has sold out of this colour, while the 3T will soon be stocked in it. So you’ll have to wait if you prefer Gold to Gunmetal, but the 3T is the way to go.
Yet for all the similarities, we’re still inclined to recommend the OnePlus 3T. It has a bigger battery, lightning fast speeds and a selfie camera that means video calls are actually worthwhile experiences. While nitpicking indeed, the software updates are also commendable, and the overall experience is (just) better than the five month old, soon-to-be-gone OnePlus 3. It’s an odd dilemma to have from a company that had until now made your buying choice very simple.
In a few weeks you’ll only be able to get a OnePlus 3T, but for now, there’s a decision to be made for prospective buyers.The OnePlus 3 has, like the newer 3T, 6GB RAM and come December will also run Android Nougat. Sure, we love the changes to the 3T and the Gunmetal colour is awesome, but you can’t even see it with a case on and in everyday use, you can barely notice the difference in speed. You can just about tell the battery life is better though, but it was already excellent on the OnePlus 3. Don’t panic – you don’t need to upgrade unless you want a OnePlus phone with 128GB of storage.
All in all, the alert slider is a great idea, improving on Apple iPhone silencer switch, and is a button you’ll miss if you use other phones afterwards.
The best thing about these tweaks is the way they simply blend into the OS and are intuitive, thoughtful upgrades. OnePlus confirmed that the 3 and the 3T will both receive updates to Android Nougat 7.0 in December 2016. We hope there is more of the same incremental updates rather than a full overhaul, because Oxygen OS 3.5.1 is very good indeed. Nor would it make sense for OnePlus to work so hard on an upgrade that most users would only see for one month.
An update to Android 7.0 Nougat began rolling out for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T at the end of December, ahead of many of its rivals. Note that we have reviewed this phone running Marshmallow, not Nougat.
Oxygen OS 3.5.1 is the new version, compared to the 3.2.7 we had installed on the older OnePlus 3 at the time of writing. Nevermind the decimals, here are the differences. Menus, in settings for example, look cleaner with no lines between options, a neater top bar and a bluer default font from the green of the 3. To be honest, they are minor changes, like the layout of the notification bar that you pull down from the top of the screen. In the comparison pictures below you can see the changes (OnePlus 3 on the left, OnePlus 3T on the right).

The panorama mode stitched together a mountain view exceptionally well, giving full detail to the scene. A football match in cloudy weather was reproduced well with no blur and in a low-lit church the camera reproduced colour and shadow to a high quality level.
Included in the box is OnePlus’ Dash Charger. The brick and cable, only when used together (important to note this point) charge the phone to 60 percent in 30 minutes. This is OnePlus’ claim, and it rings true – Dash Charge is excellent. It means you need not charge your 3T overnight, instead giving it a quick boost when you get up in the morning. There's also a Dash Charger for your car in the shop.
Not only does this encourage a better way to charge your phone (sometimes lithium-ion batteries degrade with overnight overcharging) while allowing you to top up very quickly, but also more importantly means you won’t panic about running out of juice for all but the most phone-focussed of days – and that is something that every smartphone user wants, bar none.
The slight downside is that this fast charging only works with the included combo of plug and cable. Any other USB-C cable will charge it, but at a slower rate. OnePlus sells the Dash Power Bundle for £27.53.
This was when using the device as our primary email sender and using apps like Slack, Spotify, Pocket, WhatsApp, train timetable apps, GPS battery-drainers like Google Maps and several others throughout the day. The battery percentage chugs down at the expected rate, and we didn’t experience any dramatic unexpected fall-off.
Tapping the same sensor acts as a home button, and is so good that when we try phones with physical buttons it feels wrong. The best devices change our habits for the good, and the OnePlus 3T has the best fingerprint sensor/home button combo of any current smartphone on the market.
Having said that the 3T is faster, yet only noticeably so if you are really hammering it at full pelt. It joins the Google Pixel and Pixel XL in having Qualcomm’s top of the line Snapdragon 821 processor, the current pinnacle of smartphone chips. While only the most graphically intensive games and busiest of multitasking days will make the 820 sweat, the 821 is faster on the OnePlus 3T. Going from the 3 to the 3T, the difference is noticeable if incredibly subtle.
In a full week of use we experienced absolutely no lag, slow app changes or overheating. It is truly like using a desktop at some times, and even has more RAM than some of those computers with 6GB on board. Pair that with Adreno 530 graphics and you have an obscenely powerful smartphone in your pocket – alongside your fat wallet full of the money you’ve saved by choosing it.
Our benchmarks show the OnePlus 3T runs equal with the best smartphones out there, though remember these benchmarks don’t represent real world use. The phones in this graph are the absolute best you can get right now, and broadly all perform to the same unbeatable standards.
Note: OnePlus has been caught cheating popular benchmarks such as Geekbench and GFXBench with its OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T. XDA-Developers accuses OnePlus of having configured the processor to automatically switch into overdrive mode when a popular benchmark is detected (you can read the full story here).
OnePlus has confirmed the practice and apologised, stating that ""In order to give users a better user experience in resource intensive apps and games, especially graphically intensive ones, we implemented certain mechanisms in the community and Nougat builds to trigger the processor to run more aggressively. The trigger process for benchmarking apps will not be present in upcoming OxygenOS builds on the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T.""
For now you can see our benchmark results below as accurate as they were run on OxygenOS before the changes were implemented. Also note that with the flagship-level hardware onboard both phones should be decent performers, and behaved as such during real-world testing.
Apparently carved out of one piece of space-grade aluminium alloy the OnePlus 3T measures 153 x 75 x 7.4mm and weighs 158g. The frame of the handset houses a power/lock button on the right edge, a USB-C port, speaker, mic and 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom and a volume rocker and OnePlus’ excellent Alert Slider on the left, leaving the top edge flat, curved and smooth. With a front facing fingerprint scanner that relies on haptic feedback as opposed to a physical button, this is a phone that screams ‘use me’ from the second you take it out the box.
In that box it also already comes with a screen protector pre-applied, handy if you want to use it with one. The only lines that break the dark gunmetal of our review unit are the aerial lines and the OnePlus logo that sits beneath a 16Mp camera that protrudes ever so slightly from the casing. The front facing camera sits next to the earpiece and is also an amazing 16Mp, something we’ll explore later.
The Soft Gold version is very good looking too, but is only available in 64GB. 
In the UK you can get the OnePlus 3T from O2 on a 24-month contract deal, for both the 64GB or 128GB models. Bear in mind that it’s only available on O2’s Refresh tariff that allows you to upgrade your handset more regularly.
The Midnight Edition is very similar but without the Collette branding and features ""space-grade aluminum with three carefully applied dark coatings 14 microns thick and maintains the natural look and feel of metal.""
The first 250 units of the Midnight Edition were available from Hypebeast on 24 March, but as of 28 March can now purchase the OnePlus 3T in the official OnePlus Store. It is sold with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, and priced at $479, €479 and £439.
The OnePlus 3 was a sublime blend of design and performance for just over £300, and launched in June 2016. So it seemed a little odd that just five months later OnePlus ended production of that handset, releasing the upgraded OnePlus 3T.
But OnePlus prides itself on listening to its fans’ reaction to its products, and has boldly dared to update a handset that people have had for less than half a year. It's constantly updating its products - for example, in March 2017 it announced new Collette and Midnight Black editions (read more about the latter below).
It’s difficult not to compare the 3T to the OnePlus 3. Since there’s only five months between iterative updates to a high-end phone, we have to compare the two to fully understand the reasons why.
",http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/high-end-smartphones/oneplus-3t-review-3649630/
"In the past, OnePlus focused on one primary flagship per year, though this changed in 2016. Only six months after the OnePlus 3 was first announced, OnePlus returned again with the OnePlus 3T. As the name suggests, this device is essentially a souped up, or “Turbo” version of the OnePlus 3 that builds on everything we loved about the first, while giving it a slightly more competitive edge against the competition.
A few months later, the first 2017 flagships have started to surface but the OnePlus 3T remains one of the best options on the market, especially for those that are price conscientious. So what exactly does the OnePlus 3T bring to the table, and how does it compare to the OnePlus 3, as well as more recent competition? Let’s dive in and find out.
As far as the design is concerened, the OnePlus 3T looks exactly like its older sibling, and features the same full metal unibody construction, with a slightly curved back and rounded sides and corners. Despite being made entirely of metal, the phone is surprisingly light, and because the back tapers along the edges, it feels thinner as well, making for a device that is very comfortable to hold.
The OnePlus 3T is available in the same gold variant as the OnePlus 3, but the second color option is gunmetal instead of silver. The gunmetal version comes with both 64 and 128 GB options, while the gold iteration only comes with 64 GB of on-board storage.
At the bottom is the headphone jack, the USB Type-C port, and the single speaker unit, and up front is the home button with the integrated fingerprint scanner, flanked by capacitive back and Recent Apps keys. The back key is on the left and the Recent Apps key is on the right by default, but you can flip the orientation if you prefer in the Settings.
Things remain unchanged on the display side, with the OnePlus 3T also coming with a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a 1080p resolution. As is expected from an AMOLED screen, you get rich and vibrant colors with a lot of contrast, and the optional dark mode that is built-in to Oxygen OS takes fanastic advantage of the deep inky blacks. If you aren’t a fan of the vibrancy though, it is also easy to switch to a sRGB color mode in the Display Settings that provides a more natural and less saturated look.
There aren’t a whole lot of differences between the OnePlus 3 and the 3T, but performance is one area that has seen an improvement. Under the hood, the OnePlus 3T comes with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, clocked at 2.35 GHz, which is faster than the one found in the Google Pixel smartphones. The 3T retains the 6 GB of RAM that is also available with the OnePlus 3.
With 6 GB of RAM, multitasking isn’t an issue either, and you can have a lot of apps in running the background and keep them for a very long time. The OnePlus 3T features one of the quickest and smoothest Android experiences out there. Granted, it may not be as smooth as the experience available with the Pixel devices, but it is certainly up there among the best.
As mentioned, 64 GB and 128 GB are the internal storage options available, but if storage is a concern, users will have to opt for the higher variant, with expandable storage via microSD card not being available. Getting the 128 GB model means that you will also get the new gunmetal color.
Another area where the OnePlus 3T has received an upgrade is in the battery department, with the device coming with a 3,400 mAh battery, which is a slight bump when compared to the 3,000 mAh unit available with the OnePlus 3. The 13% bump in battery capacity is more impressive when you consider the fact that OnePlus was able to achieve it without making the phone any heavier or thicker than its namesake.
OnePlus claims that you can get a full day of battery life after charging the device for just half an hour. In my experience, that translates to a charge to 60% in half an hour, which is certainly impressive, and very useful if you don’t have a lot of time to fully charge your phone.
As far as the battery life is concerned, the overall experience has been extremely good. The phone easily lasts all day even with my fairly heavy usage, which typically consists of several hours of gaming, watching videos on Youtube, and streaming music, throughout the day. So, while this bump in battery capacity may seem small, it seems to make a significant difference to the battery life.
The final area that has seen an upgrade from the OnePlus 3 is with the camera, but this change is more focused on the front-facing shooter, which is now a 16 MP unit, which is double the 8 MP sensor that was found with the OnePlus 3. The rear camera is the same 16 MP unit that was available with the OnePlus 3, and  comes with a f/2.0 aperture, optical image stabilization, and phase detection autofocus.
The default camera app is pretty similar to the Google Camera, with many of the same modes to be found here, including Timelapse, Slow motion, and Panorama. The only exception is that manual controls are available if you are looking to dial in the setting yourself, but it is otherwise a very nicely laid out and easy to use camera application.
In terms of dynamic range, the camera does have a tendency to overexpose the shot and blow out a lot of the highlights, but HDR mode alleviates this problem easily. It does a great job of pulling extra detail from the highlights and shadows, while still maintaining the natural look of the original image. Low-light shots can be good, but onl when using the HQ mode. Without it, images are noisy and soft, and the mode allows for sharper, more detailed images that are a lot cleaner.
On the software side of things, the OnePlus 3T is running the latest Oxygen OS 3.5.1 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and you get a very stock Android look and feel here, but with a lot of customizations available that add to the experience without getting in the way.
A few new customization options have been added to the latest version of the Oxygen OS, such as a built-in night mode, that makes the viewing the screen easier on your eyes at night. There are custom accent colors, support for third party icon packs, and the screen off gestures like double tap to wake, or the ability to launch the camera or flashlight by drawing on O or a V on the screen.
Despite still being based on Android Marshmallow, OnePlus has also updated the notification shade to the Android 7.0 Nougat style that comes with easy access to the Quick Settings with one downward swipe. OnePlus hasn’t announced a specific date as to when an official update to Android 7.0 Nougat will be available, but it is slated for the end of the year, and will be made available for both the OnePlus 3 and 3T.
The faster processor, an improved front-facing camera, and larger battery capacity also results in a bump in the price point, with the 64 GB model priced at $439, and the 128 GB iteration setting you back an additional $40. The OnePlus 3T will be available on November 22 in the US and November 28 in Europe.
You can truly tailor the experience to exactly the way you like it, and that is one of the best parts about Oxygen OS. This updated version introduces some new features to further refine the experience. You can now swipe down on the screen with three fingers to take a screenshot, and add a password or use your fingerprint to lock down any application.

Shelf is still accessible by swiping to the left of the home screen, and holds a lot of information, including the weather info and your recent contacts or used apps. You can also compose memos and manage your data, storage, and battery life, and there any widget can be added here, instead of having them take up space on the other home screens.

This is definitely a good camera with it comes to picture quality. Photos are crisp and well detailed, and I really like the color reproduction. You get nice, natural looking colors, and the images are sharp enough, but without looking oversharpened and artificial. If you do want some extra sharpening, the HQ mode is available, which adds a fairly noticeable amount of sharpening to the photos. However, the images looked fine in most situations, and I rarely had to use this feature.

The front-facing camera also comes with an f/2.0 aperture, which helps a lot when taking selfies in low-light conditions. With the bump in megapixel count, you will also have a lot more room to zoom and crop without any deterioration in the quality of the picture, and also enjoy sharper looking video. Overall, you get a far better experience with the front-facing shooter now than you did with the OnePlus 3.

OnePlus’ Dash Charge technology is available here to quickly get the phone back up to a full charge. The biggest advantage with this technology however is that the majority of the heat that is generated during charging is contained in the wall adapter and doesn’t make its way to the device. This also means that you can use the phone while it is charging, without worrying about the charging speeds being throttled in order to control the device temperature.

The fingerprint sensor that is integrated into the home button up front does unlock the device really quickly, but it is unfortunately not the most accurate scanner out there. It is fairly reliable, but there have been quite a few instances where it misreads my fingerprint. You can also add a variety of long press and double tap functions to the home button and the capacitive keys.

Not surprisingly, the performance is absolutely fantastic with the OnePlus 3T, with the comparatively lower resolution display a contributing factor as well. Opening, closing, and switching between apps is smooth and snappy, the touch responsiveness is excellent, and the device also handles graphic-intensive gaming comfortably, with no dropped frames to be seen.

Brightness isn’t a concern and allows for comfortable outdoor visibility. Sharpness isn’t a problem either, and to the naked eye, the difference between this 1080p panel and other Quad HD screen won’t be noticeable, unless you are using the phone for VR. OnePlus feels that VR isn’t mainstream enough to justify the jump to Quad HD, and decided to stick to 1080p to aid with the battery life.

As was the case with the OnePlus 3, build quality is not an issue here, and everything is very well put together. Taking a look around the device, the power button and volume rocker are on the right and left sides respectively, and the buttons feel very tactile and are easy to press. Above the volume rocker is the very useful Notification Slider, that lets you quickly toggle between silent, do not disturb, and full volume options.

It’s also not a very tall or wide phone and is only slightly larger than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, allowing for a comfortable one-handed experience despite coming with a 5.5-inch display. There isn’t any 3T logo anywhere on the device that explicitly indicates that this is the upgraded flagship, and the only way to to really distinguish it from the older OnePlus 3 is by the color.

"When OnePlus launched its flagship phone, the OnePlus 3, earlier this year, the company was forced to suspend sales in Europe for five weeks because the product was selling so well.
The first and most striking similarity between the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T is its design. You'd be forgiven for not being able to instantly distinguish between the two phones in the same way you can't with Apple's incremental updates, for instance.
The latest, OnePlus 3T model is available in a darker colour than the original 3, named ‘gunmetal’ as well as a 'soft gold' colour, but the body is still made of the same aluminium alloy as its predecessor.
As the OnePlus 3T has the same screen as the OnePlus 3, there is no deviance here from the earlier device. The device is bright and has vivid colours, and like the OnePlus 3, has a dual polarizing layer designed to make the phone’s screen easier to see in the brightest daylight. Unfortunately, the dark winter weather means it hasn’t been possible to fully test this out but as it worked well on the 3, it would stand to reason this is the same on the OnePlus 3T.
OxygenOS, OnePlus’s custom operating software, has been revamped for the OnePlus 3T. This does make the device more user-friendly – especially when compared to other Android devices – and has elements such as on-screen buttons to take you back and to the homepage alongside resized app icons to make the phone look cleaner and more uniform.
OnePlus has also upgraded OxygenOS by increasing the speed and cadence of its software updates, but we have yet to try that out.
On our 128GB review device, the software and files occupied around 15GB. Although this left a significant amount of storage for our own apps, pictures and so on, we were staggered at how much the default files took up. Considering some manufacturers, namely Samsung, sell devices where the software occupies around half of and most of that consists of a considerable amount of bloatware, OnePlus disappointed us. That said, when the OnePlus 3T 128GB version costs £439, compared to the 128GB iPhone 7 which costs £699, you still get a lot of storage for you money.
More recently, Google rolled out its Google Assistant AI software to the OnePlus 3T. Once the software update has been applied, the smart assistant can be launched simply by pressing down on the homepage.
This is finally where the OnePlus 3T starts to stand apart from the previous model. The new phone has 16MP front and back cameras that make your selfies look amazing. As phone owners, we are increasingly using our front cameras more than rear ones: for apps such as Snapchat, FaceTime and Skype, so it makes sense for brands to tap into this. By comparison, the iPhone 7’s front camera is 7MP, with a 12MP back camera while the iPhone 7 Plus has 12MP cameras front and back, meaning the OnePlus 3T stands up against these devices.
For budding photographers, the manual mode has been added to the OnePlus 3T to give the phone’s owners access to settings you typically only get on a DSLR. You can change the white balance, ISO, focus and shutter speed to fit specific needs for an image. Most users probably won’t bother with these settings, but it's features like these that will make the OnePlus 3T stand out in the mid-range smartphone market against devices such as the Huawei P9. In particular, the OnePlus 3T offers fantastic camera options at a cheaper price point than the P9.
The OnePlus 3T has received an upgrade in terms of performance. The new device uses the latest version of Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processes up to 2.35GHz, whereas the OnePlus 3 was powered by Snapdragon 820. This means the phone has faster processing speeds and greater efficiency but still uses the same battery consumption as Snapdragon 820.
OnePlus has stayed true to the changes it made to the OnePlus 3 and incorporated Dash Charge technology into the OnePlus 3T. The phone receives 60 per cent charge for the 3,400 mAh battery (which is an improvement on the 3’s 3000 mAh) in 30 minutes which is great when you don’t have the time to wait around for you phone to fully charge. The boosted battery has also had its capacity increased by 13 per cent, while keeping the phone the same weight and volume as the 3.
WIRED gave the OnePlus 3 a 9/10 rating and it appeared the brand lived up to its name as an ‘Apple killer’ with the launch of the flagship device. The OnePlus 3T is merely a continuation of this, with some better features such as the improved front camera and battery, but overall it hasn’t deviated much from the design of the earlier device.
The OnePlus 3T is more expensive too. The 64GB OnePlus 3 was £329 compared to the 64GB OnePlus 3T which retails at £399. This is a large increase for what doesn’t really seem like much. It makes you partly question why OnePlus decided to release a slightly upgraded phone instead of waiting to unveil something different. This would then warrant the different price tag.

It's worth nothing that OnePlus has said that once the OnePlus 3 is all sold out, the company will not be making anymore and its customers will have to buy the OnePlus 3T instead. This probably won’t go down too well with fans who might not want to pay a higher price for what isn't a markedly different phone.

Having said this, the OnePlus 3T is a stylish phone and it is one of the few Android devices we would consider ditching iOS for. The size of the screen is great, the improved camera is a plus and compared to other Android devices, it is relatively straightforward to use. Despite the price increase, it still makes the phone one of the most affordable smartphones, in terms of specs, on the market. If OnePlus can continue doing this with its next devices, it will be interesting to watch where this takes the brand.

The OnePlus 3T is available to buy from OnePlus.net or O2. There had been a delay due to shortage of shipments but OnePlus has solved the problem and recently confirmed it's aiming to have the OnePlus 3T available for ""immediate delivery"" in Europe and North America. This removed the need for a waiting list.

As of February 10, OnePlus opened pre-orders for the gunmetal version of the 128GB OnePlus 3T. The immediate dispatch of OnePlus 3T 64GB in Soft Gold started on February 3 and the OnePlus 3T 64GB in gunmetal is already on sale. Additionally, on March 15, OnePlus announced it had partnered with colette to release an all-black edition of the phone, the OnePlus 3T colette edition. To mark the concept store's 20th anniversary, OnePlus announced plans to host a pop-up shop at the colette store in Paris. This limited edition range was later expanded online.

Dash Charge works by shifting the power management processes of the phone to the adapter so the OnePlus 3T doesn’t get hot when charging. Particularly as other brands like Samsung have had significant difficulties with charging phones, it is good to see a brand like OnePlus creating a faster battery whilst also ensuring it is safe for its users.

Again, like the OnePlus 3, it features 6GB of LPDDR4 Ram to make the handset function faster. This means elements like unlocking the phone with the fingerprint scanner is much faster compared with say, the iPhone 6, 6S or iPhone 7 range. This definitely appeared true: we hardly ever needed to type in a passcode to access the phone as the fingerprint scanner works so well.

Also, you can see the date and time on the phone by simply holding your hand over the screen. This is slightly gimmicky, but sometimes you may only need your smartphone to check the time and this is an amusing extra feature.

Again, like the OnePlus 3, the OnePlus 3T’s rear camera is covered by a protective layer of sapphire glass to prevent it from scratching.

An added benefit of the 16MP front camera means it produces clearer photos and video, even in low-light situations. The rear camera uses a 16MP Sony PDAF sensor with f.20 aperture that’s capable of processing 4K video.

The OnePlus 3T additionally has an upgraded Electronic Image Stabilisation (EIS) algorithm for more stable videos and Optical Image Stabilisation to ""mechanically compensate"" for unwanted jolts and shakes. This debuted on the OnePlus 3, but it's good to see this is continuing to be developed by OnePlus.

Mid-January, OnePlus released OxygenOS 4.0.2 a continuation of the Android 7.0 Nougat-based OxygenOS 4.0 software for OnePlus phones. It brought the software closer in line with the pure Android software but doesn't quite offer some of the features in Android 7.1.

One element we liked, in particular, was the 'Clear All' mode for recent apps. By pressing the hollow square on the screen, it brings up all the open apps. Instead of going through and individually closing them, it is possible to close them all at once using a single button. This helps keep the phone working efficiently and improved our overall experience.

Like the OnePlus 3, the OnePlus 3T ships with a pre-installed Gorilla Glass 4 screen protector which is a welcome addition. When you’re spending a lot of money on a device, sometimes over £700, extra protection for a screen is always a nice perk. Plus it's nice to have such protection as standard, rather than paying a premium and this is a sign that OnePlus knows what its customers want from a device.

However, this protector smudges very easily, much more so than other smartphone screen protectors we have used, and this can make the phone appear dirty and used even when it's new.

OnePlus 3 available to buy in O2 stores

OnePlus 3 available to buy in O2 stores
By AMELIA HEATHMAN
Elsewhere, both devices are 7.35mm thick and have 5.5-inch 1080p Optic Amoled displays. The screen benefits from the phone's thin bezel, though again, this is no different to the OnePlus 3.

It appears OnePlus hasn't upgraded its cases since the OnePlus 3, either. The downside is that the case provided with the OnePlus 3T feels cheap when compared to the phone itself, and it isn’t easy to add or remove from the phone. On the plus side though, if you have a favourite OnePlus 3 case, you will be able to use this on the OnePlus 3T as the phone hasn't changed in size.

Rather than ride this wave of success until next year when cycles dictate OnePlus should bring out its next smartphone, it has decided to jump ahead and release an upgrade: the OnePlus 3T. Unfortunately, the phone seems exactly like the OnePlus 3 with only minor upgrades that don't appear to justify the new device's price increase - certainly not if you're already a OnePlus 3 owner.

In what appears to be a direct nod to Apple and its own incremental 'S' updates, can the OnePlus 3T stand out in its own right and take on its major rivals?
",
"The OnePlus 3T is a relatively light, internal-only revision of the impressive OnePlus 3. It brings the phone right up to date, putting it head-to-head with the Google Pixel.
Put the OnePlus 3 next to the OnePlus 3T and unless you are familiar with the colors — the OnePlus 3T ditches silver for a stylish gunmetal finish, and also comes in a stunning, limited edition black finish — it’s absolutely impossible to tell them apart. There was no sense in changing the OnePlus 3’s design after just six months, because it was solid to start with.
The OnePlus 3T replaces the sandpaper-like body of the old OnePlus 2 for smooth metal, with a sleek, minimal design. There’s a solitary OnePlus logo stamped on the back, bookended by iPhone and HTC-like antenna breaks, and a slightly raised camera lens. That’s it. It’s a real beauty.

The fingerprint sensor always recognized my print with astonishing speed, and there’s NFC in the OnePlus 3T, so the phone supports Android Pay. Mobile payments are hit or miss, but Android Pay’s problems are hardly unique to the 3T.
The primary change between the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T is the replacement of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 with the newer and more powerful Snapdragon 821 processor. Yes it has since been superseded by Qualcomm with the Snapdragon 835, but that’s only available in a handful of very expensive phones at the moment. The RAM remains the same at 6GB, and although there are a few other alterations, the chip swap is undoubtedly the main reason why the 3T is more expensive. Therefore, you’ll want to see a noticeable performance bump, right?
Time to turn to benchmarks. Putting the OnePlus 3T up against the OnePlus 3 this way is perhaps the easiest way to find any differences. AnTuTu 3D on the OnePlus 3 scores 144,131, and the same test on the OnePlus 3T comes back with 166,912. Both were run in the same environment, with no other apps running, and on the most up-to-date public release version of OxygenOS.
However, many will be asking that if you can’t see the differences going about your day-to-day business, is there really any point? If you already own the OnePlus 3, then no, probably not. However, by selecting the 3T you’re getting a newer phone that will still keep pace with high-end phones for longer, and longevity is very important in the smartphone world. It also makes the phone even more cost-effective.
The OnePlus 3T has the same 16-megapixel camera as the OnePlus 3. It has an f/2.0 aperture, optical image stabilization, HDR, and a 1.28-inch sensor. However, OnePlus has tweaked the software. The ultra-high contrast images taken with the OnePlus 3 have been toned down ever-so slightly, so the OnePlus 3T takes pictures that are more natural, but still pleasingly vivid.
Around the front, the OnePlus 3T has a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The reason for this massive sensor is not just for selfie-lovers, but for live-streamers who demand a high-definition image. It’s great, and even in low-light — when the camera combines pixels to artificially boost the light — it does well. There’s a simple beauty mode, and a feature where it’s supposed to recognize smiles and activate the shutter, but it never worked for us.
The OnePlus 3T runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat in the OxygenOS 4.1.3 user interface, modifying the operating system slightly from Google’s vision. It’s not a drastic alteration, and it’s closer to how Motorola deals with Android than a more heavy UI favored by Samsung. Purists will be pleased to note the app drawer is present and the notification shade is as Google intended. Our midnight black version has the March 1 Android security patch installed, bringing it almost up-to-date. April and May security updates are out from Google, though, so we hope OnePlus will quickly follow through.
OxygenOS was unshakeable and we haven’t had any stability issues, or any unwillingness to run any app we threw at it. SwiftKey’s keyboard is an option, but due to personal preference, we chose Google’s Android keyboard, which performs brilliantly, and we love the subtle haptic feedback.
Even though the OnePlus 3T has the same dimensions as the OnePlus 3, it contains a larger capacity 3,400mAh battery, which we found to last about a day with moderately heavy use. You can elongate battery life even further, using the battery saver, which turns off location, background data, and the vibrate feature. You know when it’s active, because the notification bar turns bright orange. One thing we do like is the chance to display the battery icon as a circle and not a bar. It’s much easier to visualise the remaining time, if you choose not to show the percentage figure.
The much-hated invitation system is a thing of the past, and you can buy a OnePlus 3T through OnePlus’ own online store right now. If you’re in the U.K., OnePlus has secured its first network deal, and the phone can be purchased through O2 with a two-year plan.
OnePlus has a one-year warranty on its devices in the United States, where device defects will be repaired or a replacement device will be provided for free, including the shipping and handling costs. It doesn’t cover wear and tear, or water damage. Alternatively, OnePlus offers an extended warranty plan though Assurant Solutions called On-Guard. Plans can be for a year, 18 months, or two years, and see devices repaired or replaced in the U.S., rather than China. This means the turnaround should be quicker. Costs range from $20 to $110 extra.
The OnePlus 3T has enough power to birth small galaxies, and more style than the pages of a glossy fashion magazine, yet still manages to leave hundreds of dollars in your pocket when you choose it over the competition. One or two software problems did show up — video recorder, and the smile shutter for example — but we hope these will be fixed in the near future, and they aren’t enough to put us off.
However, we always recommend buying a phone without a contract, if possible, and it’s definitely the way to buy the OnePlus 3T; but it’s more expensive that the OnePlus 3 It’s $440 for the 64GB model, which is $40 more than the equivalent — and now discontinued — OnePlus 3. The 128GB model is $480, and you have to choose that configuration if you want the midnight black model. In the U.K., the price has increased to 400 British pounds, up from the 330 British pounds the OnePlus 3 cost during the summer, and a whopping 80 British pounds more than the 310 British pounds it started out costing.

The Dash Charge fast-charging system is back, and OnePlus claims it will charge the battery to 60 percent capacity in just 30 minutes. Our tests showed this to be accurate, and a timed run saw 60 percent arrive in 31 minutes. A full charge was completed in an hour and 20 minutes. The same as we achieved with the OnePlus 3.

Depending on which model you buy, you can get either 64GB or 128GB of internal memory, but sadly there’s no MicroSD card slot to increase your storage. OnePlus decided not to go for one of the new dual-SIM trays that has the option of using one of the slots for a memory card, so the 3T is a strictly dual-SIM device. For this reason, we suggest opting for the 128GB OnePlus 3T, especially as the phone’s performance will see it last for several years before it needs replacing.

There are a few modifications included in OxygenOS. The most noticeable is Shelf, which slides in from the left of the home screen, where you can find shortcuts to frequently used apps, space for Android widgets, the weather, and a space to write memos. It’s easy to turn off OnePlus’ Shelf option if you don’t like it.

OnePlus installs its own gallery app, file manager app, music player, voice recorder, and a new Community app. This is an odd one, but in line with OnePlus’ commitment to interacting with its loyal users. It gives direct access to the company’s busy online forums, and it’s a bit like looking at a self-diagnosis website when you’re sick. The forums have plenty of complaints and moans, most of which are isolated incidents, but it can make you go looking for problems when none really exist.

Swipe to the right to access a manual mode, where ISO, focus, shutter speed, and brightness can be adjusted. A tripod is necessary to get the best from the manual mode, but the OnePlus 3T takes great photos without messing around with the settings. The software is fast and easy to use, but when shooting video, it oddly shows a far larger image in the viewfinder, meaning objects you think fill the frame are actually far too close. Annoyingly, this issue still hasn’t been cured on our newly delivered, and up-to-date midnight black 3T.

Close-up photos blur the background very nicely, and on a sunny day, blue skies shine beautifully. With HDR activated, shadowy areas lit up sufficiently without sacrificing detail. In low-light, plenty of detail is revealed, and although it can’t quite keep pace with the iPhone 7 Plus or Google Pixel, you won’t be disappointed. Shots of lit buildings in the dark saw the 3T create fantastic, inky blacks, but the OIS couldn’t quite keep things steady enough to maintain detail.

There are some other changes that won’t be instantly noticeable, either, but are definite benefits. The OnePlus 3T runs cooler when under pressure than the 3, and the increased power efficiency offered by the Snapdragon 821 means the larger capacity 3,400mAh battery will last even longer.

There wasn’t a moment when the OnePlus 3T felt like anything other than a rocket ship, and there was no point where more power would have been helpful. This is simply one of the highest performing smartphones you can buy, and one of the fastest smartphones we’ve ever tried.

That’s a big difference, and not only does it crush just about every other phone out there, but the spankings continued through other tests as well. Geekbench 4 returned 4,133 multi-core on the OnePlus 3 and 4,390 multi-core on the OnePlus 3T. We ran 3DMark’s Slingshot ES3.1 gaming benchmarking test on both, too. The OnePlus 3 scored 2,561, while the OnePlus 3T came back with 2,700.

It’s difficult to tell the difference. It’s not like the OnePlus 3 performed like it was wading through six feet of sludge. Putting the two alongside each other and seeing if there was any visible difference seemed like a good place to start. A few searches in Chrome, scrolling through lists on Twitter, and playing side-by-side games revealed … no discernible difference whatsoever.

The OnePlus 3T has a 5.5-inch Optic AMOLED screen with a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. What’s Optic AMOLED? According to OnePlus CEO Carl Pei, the Samsung-supplied screens feature a dual-polarizing layer that’s tuned for improved color temperature and contrast. On the OnePlus 3, it was always a pain to “tune” using the basic controls, but that’s changed on the OnePlus 3T. Out of the box, it looks amazing, and the true whites really shine through in a way that was difficult to achieve on the 3. If it’s too stark, under a Screen Calibration setting, there’s an eye-pleasing sRGB option, and a custom setting with a warm-to-cool slider.

Don’t for one second think the 1080p resolution holds the OnePlus 3T back. It’s stunning, and further proof a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution isn’t really essential on a smartphone of this size. If there is one slight downside, it’s the outdoor performance in sunlight. The screen is highly reflective, and the brightness never elevates itself to a high enough level for super visibility.

Pick it up, and the sides are subtly curved and completely smooth. It fits in your palm extremely well. We hold our phones many times during the day, and comfort is very important. However, since the OnePlus 3 made its debut, in-hand comfort has been taken to the next level by phones such as the ZTE Axon 7 and the Huawei Nova. The OnePlus 3T can’t quite match the thought and effort that went into shaping the Axon 7’s body in particular. It’s not like it’s covered in thorns, but the game has definitely moved on from the somewhat sharp edges of the 3T. It’s slippery too.The OnePlus 3T is very compact, with a body that’s very slim and weighs just 158 grams. The bezels around the screen are slim, but it doesn’t have the bezel-less display that’s now a feature on premium phones like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. Choose the midnight black model, and the dark colors do a great job of disguising the size of the phone in general, and because the antenna lines are also black, the rear of the device is even more minimally styled.

If you swooned at the sight of the OnePlus 3, then the 3T will make you weak at the knees, too.

A pane of curved 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 covers the screen, completing the slick modern design. It’s punctuated only by the fingerprint sensor, which doubles as the home button. On the side of the body, the notification alert slider makes a welcome return. The two-stage switch lets you selectively mute alerts, based on importance. It’s a time-saver, and the switch itself has a cool knurled pattern for grip. Its placement at the top left of the device is a little odd, but only if you’re right handed.

A Google Pixel will cost you $650, but the OnePlus 3T is $440. That’s a massive savings, and although OnePlus bumped the price of the 3T up by $40 over the OnePlus 3’s $400 price tag, it’s still way cheaper than the Galaxy S8, the LG G6, or any other big-brand flagship Android phone on sale today. The insanely low price is low enough to make you wonder: Why is it so cheap?

The OnePlus 3 was the best phone OnePlus had made, and one we highly recommended. Can a revision that adds newer hardware to a winning package do anything other than improve on the original? We’ve been finding out, and have revisited the OnePlus 3T on release of the midnight black model.
",https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-3t-review/
"The OnePlus 3 was £329. Well, originally it was £309, but then the pound tanked and the price increased. The OnePlus 3T goes in at £399 for the 64GB model, or £439 for the 128GB model – that’s an important distinction, because unlike other Android smartphones, there is no expandable memory here. What you buy is what you’re stuck with.
So, what do you get for the money? There are three main improvements: processor, battery life and camera. I’ll tackle these one by one. Processing duties in the OnePlus 3T are now handled by the 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. The OnePlus 3 had a 2.15GHz Snapdragon 820 – which was hardly a slowpoke – but this is a welcome upgrade all the same.
Finally, there’s the camera, although if you were expecting big improvements to the main camera, you’ll be disappointed. Although the rear camera gets a tougher sapphire lens cover, the main camera improvements I mentioned in the introduction are reserved for the front-facing selfie camera, which captures images now a whopping 16 megapixels in resolution. Impressive, but possibly overkill for most, barring the most vain.
If you're looking to get the OnePlus 3T (or the OnePlus 3), you'll be pleased to know that both now come with Android 7 Nougat. This now features fantastic multitasking support with multiple windows, a notification overhaul over Android 6 Marshmallow, extra security features and increased graphical performance thanks to Vulkan.
Typically, I’d discuss the design and display at this point, but since they’re the same as the OnePlus 3, I’ll cut straight to the chase and get stuck into performance. (Don’t worry completionists, it’s a postponement rather than an omission.)
Along with the processor upgrade, the OnePlus 3T inherits its predecessor’s impressive list of core specifications. Namely, that Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 is backed up by 6GB of RAM and includes Qualcomm’s Adreno 530 graphics processing unit. As you’d imagine, these top-of-the-range specifications result in a smartphone that’s an absolute pleasure to use, and one that comfortably handles anything you throw its way.
But then, so did the OnePlus 3. So how does it compare in our more objective benchmark tests? First up is Geekbench 4, which measures a handset’s single- and multi-core processing performance.
In these benchmarks, we see a clear – if moderate – improvement in the OnePlus 3T over the 3. In single-core it’s 1,903 to 1,689, and in multi-core it’s 4,273 to 4,026. However, it’s only in comparing these scores with the flagship smartphone landscape that you see the true triumph here. Despite retailing for between £100 and £150 cheaper than phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Google Pixel phone, the OnePlus comfortably holds its own:
Or to put that into more stark perspective, here’s that chart again, only with how many points of the Geekbench scale you get per pound (prices correct at the time of writing):
As you might expect, given both handsets use the Adreno 530 graphics chipset, 3D performance is virtually identical. That is to say, very good, but unchanged.
But what about the extra battery life? Well, the 3,400mAh should indeed give us more life, but weirdly in our standard test (a looped 720p video viewed at 170cd/m2 brightness in airplane mode), it actually fared worse than the original OnePlus 3 – lasting just 13hrs 22mins, compared with the OnePlus 3’s 16hrs 56mins.
Sometimes day-to-day use brings up markedly different results to our battery tests, however, and anecdotally I’m actually experiencing slightly better battery life than with the OnePlus 3. The improved Dash Charge tech is also impressive, although the claims of “a day’s power in half an hour” need a little extra scrutiny. While it’s true we were able to jump from 49% to 92% battery in 30 minutes (it took another 24 minutes to hit 100%), not everyone would find 43% capacity enough to get them through a day – especially if they’re a power user. Your mileage may vary.
Briefly, because we’ve already covered the OnePlus 3T’s main camera in the OnePlus 3 review, it’s good. It’s a 16-megapixel snapper with an f/2.0 aperture, phase-detect autofocus and optical image stabilisation. It’s short of laser autofocus for optimal low-light performance, but it’s generally solid.
Now back to the familiar stuff that’s identical to the last model — the design and the display. Technically, there is a minor change to the design – the rear panel is slightly flatter than on the original – but only hardcore fans would likely notice that at a glance. The anodised metal chassis looks the same, and it still feels comfortably secure in the hand, even one-handed. It has support for dual SIMs, meaning this can be your work and home phone, and it still charges via USB Type-C.
And for normal (non-VR) usage, the OnePlus 3T’s screen is just fine. We measured a good maximum brightness of 421cd/m2 and perfect contrast. Switched to sRGB mode and the screen covers 93.2% of the colour space, and it does so while looking sharp and vibrant.
So here’s the thing: the OnePlus 3T is a brilliant smartphone, and objectively improves upon the amazingly good OnePlus 3 in a couple of small but significant ways. It’s faster, and it has a bigger battery. That’s nice, but neither were complaints about the OnePlus 3 in the first place – and in making those improvements, the price has risen by around 21%.
My advice at this point would be to save £70 and buy the OnePlus 3… or it would be, if you could still buy one SIM-free. At the time of writing, the OnePlus 3 is listed as “out of stock” on the official website, and the company has stated that the OnePlus 3T will replace it rather than be sold alongside it.
That’s not to say the OnePlus 3T is a rip-off: it still gives you demonstrably more bang for your buck than anything in and above its price range. It’s just not as big a bargain as once it was.

In other words, in this respect, OnePlus has wisely decided that “it ain’t broke, so there’s no need to fix it”.



At 5.5"", it remains a big beast of a phone, albeit one that doesn’t quite feel like a phablet – and that screen is still an AMOLED 1,080 x 1,920 panel. That’s a lower resolution than some of its pricier peers, and undoubtedly where some of the cost savings are made, but unless you plan on using this for virtual reality, then it’s a sacrifice worth making. On a screen this size, anything over 1080p is tough to tell apart from its supposedly sharper QHD and 4K rivals.

So, by bringing the front-facing camera up to the same 16 megapixels, you can expect that level of performance from your selfies, right? Wrong.

As the examples below hopefully demonstrate, when compared with the Google Pixel X’s “lowly” 8-megapixel selfie snapper, you can see that the images it produces aren’t great, and have that magic combination of overexposure and unimpressive colour balance, whether they’re taken in or outdoors.
In other words, despite the price increase, the OnePlus 3T is still extremely good value – it’s just not quite the ridiculous bargain that the OnePlus 3 was.

Having Android Nougat previously launched on the HTC 10, LG G5 and Sony's Xperia XZ, it's great to see OnePlus offering same treatment. Of course, what this also means is that if you've still got a OnePlus 3, its shelf life just got extended, too.

Then there’s the battery. The capacity has increased from a 3,000mAh to 3,400mAh, which doesn’t sound a lot, but more significant is how quickly it charges. OnePlus promises a day’s charge in half an hour with the new Dash Charge system – although as this is different from Qualcomm’s Quick Charge feature, you’ll need to use the included plug to benefit.

"It’s astonishing how far smartphones have come in terms of craftsmanship, and the OnePlus 3T is another shining example of this. OnePlus 3T body is built from a single block of aluminium, which feels as premium as any flagship built by Samsung, HTC, or Apple. The rounded edges make the OnePlus 3T comfortable to hold. The button placement and tactile feedback is also very good. An Alert Slider on the left can be used to toggle between silent and Do-not-disturb (DnD) modes, each of which can be customised. Sadly, due to this physical slider, you can’t schedule DnD to kick in automatically, which is something we sorely miss.
The OnePlus 3T also seems to have a brighter display, which is evident when the two phones are placed side by side. More than colour calibration, it’s the touch latency issue which we found quite annoying. This is most bothersome when typing, and makes the keys on the keyboard feel ‘sticky’. OnePlus 3T also tends to misread some swipe gestures at times, so we would often pull up Google search when we really wanted the notification shade. OnePlus has acknowledged this issue and a fix is supposed to arrive with the Android Nougat update.
OnePlus 3T's capacitive buttons can pull triple duty, as you can program long-press and double-press actions to each of them in addition to their regular function. The ‘Gestures’ menu lets you play around with various shortcuts. In terms of apps, there’s the OnePlus Community app, Amazon, Kindle, Google suite, and basic apps like a file manager and voice recorder.
The general app and system performance of OnePlus 3T is incredibly fluid as you always have about 4GB of RAM that’s at your disposal. The generous amount of onboard storage also means you never have to worry about running out of space, even if you’re a compulsive media user. The new Qualcomm SoC can run anything your throw at it without breaking a sweat. Heavy games like Asphalt 8 run flawlessly. Even with extended use, the phone doesn’t overheat, which is quite impressive.
OnePlus 3T's front camera is the second biggest change compared to the OnePlus 3. It now features a 16-megapixel sensor from Samsung, with an f/2.0 aperture and fixed focus. Pictures are incredibly detailed in good lighting and look good under low light too. There’s a bit of visible noise but no colour noise, so pictures are still very usable. Smile capture works well and automatically starts counting down as soon as it detects your smile.
We quite liked the OnePlus 3T camera's low-light performance, as images aren’t too noisy and a fair bit of detail is preserved. Shooting modes include slow-motion video, timelapse, manual and panorama. There’s a 1080p 60fps video mode too which is good for capturing sports and action scenes. Video quality for full-HD and 4K capture was really good.
On the surface, the OnePlus 3T might seem like a minor upgrade over the OnePlus 3; the key areas being the battery capacity, higher resolution front camera and the faster CPU. However, after using it for the better part of a week, it's clear that the improvements extend to the brighter and more colour-accurate display, and faster internal storage. The newer firmware also plays a big role in providing a better all-round experience compared to its predecessor.
At its current pricing, you should clearly ignore the OnePlus 3 and spend the extra Rs. 2,000 for the OnePlus 3T, because it’s worth it. We’re not terrible convinced about the pricing for the OnePlus 3T 128GB model as we feel that a Rs. 5,000 premium isn't necessarily worth it. Don’t get us wrong; it’s still very good value even at Rs. 34,999 - but something like a quad-HD screen for this version would have helped sealed the deal nicely.

It’s really difficult to fault the OnePlus 3T as it takes everything its predecessor did well and improves upon it. Low-light camera performance is better and we have no reason to complain about the lack of expandable storage anymore. If we have to nitpick, then the lack of an FM radio might bother some people, and the touch latency issue can get annoying when typing, though OnePlus promises to fix this in the Nougat update.

If you want the best Android experience on a reasonable budget, then the OnePlus 3T is the only phone you need. But then, you already knew that.

The third notable change is that the OnePlus 3T has a 3400mAh battery. In our HD video loop test, we managed to go for 14 hours and 3 minutes, which we think is very good. During standard usage, we easily got a day and half, and a bit more at times depending on amount of gaming. OnePlus 3T's Dash charging works brilliantly, achieving a 45 percent charge in just 35 minutes, and finishing up in a little over an hour.



The 16-megapixel rear camera of OnePlus 3T supports PDAF, has an f/2.0 aperture and can capture RAW images. There’s also Optical Image Stabilisation, just like the on the older model. Landscapes and macros are highly detailed with good colour reproduction. There are some visible artifacts from JPEG compression but this is only noticeable when you zoom in all the way. The Auto HDR mode works well and you even have a HQ mode, which combines a few shots of the same frame to reduce noise, which works decently well.

The OnePlus 3T flies through benchmarks too. In AnTuTu, we got a score of 1,61,620, and 60fps in GFXbench. The punchy colours of the display make watching videos really enjoyable. The speaker is fairly loud if there isn’t too much ambient noise but isn’t too audible when you’re out and about on the street. The display has good very good sunlight legibility too with wide viewing angles. OnePlus 3T also handles 4K video playback like a champ. If we have one criticism it would be the placement of the speaker grille, which tends to get covered by your palm when gaming or watching a video.

OnePlus 3T's fingerprint sensor authenticates you quickly and you can use it to lock apps too. It also doubles as a capacitive home button, and we have two more of these on either side, which are backlit. You can swap their functions or even enable onscreen buttons for navigation, if you like. The machine-drilled holes for the speaker at the bottom add to the phone's premium aesthetics. There’s a Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone socket on the bottom too.

The gunmetal coloured back adds to the stealthy look of the OnePlus 3T smartphone. The camera bump remains, but you needn’t worry about scratches thanks to the sapphire crystal glass. In the box, you get a 20W power adapter, a Type-C cable, a SIM ejector, and some instructions. The packaging and quality of the accessories are top notch, so no complaints here. Since the dimensions of OnePlus 3T are identical to those of its predecessor, you can use cases and other accessories designed for the older model.We come to the first big improvement, and that’s the SoC. The OnePlus 3T uses Qualcomm’s newest Snapdragon 821 chip which promises roughly 10 percent better performance in areas like processing power, power consumption, and user experience. There’s 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM and a whopping 128GB of internal storage. The OnePlus 3T model we’re reviewing is the higher priced variant (Rs. 34,999) but you can also get the 3T with 64GB of storage at Rs. 29,999. The smartphone also has improved read and write speeds (at least the 128GB model does) compared to the older model. According to AndroBench results, sequential reads and writes see a 15-20 percent bump but random writes are nearly four times as fast.

Other OnePlus 3T specifications include Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, USB OTG, NFC, and GPS. FM radio is absent. The phone supports 4G on Indian bands along with VoLTE. The OnePlus 3T runs OxygenOS (3.5.3), which is based on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. These OnePlus 3T features are pretty similar to what we’ve seen before in the OnePlus 3, just rearranged and redesigned a bit. Swiping right from the home screen lets you access ‘Shelf’, a customisable screen which lets you stack widgets for quick access. Swiping down or up anywhere on the homescreen lets you access the notification shade and Google search, respectively.

The 5.5-inch AMOLED display of OnePlus 3T has the same full-HD resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 4 as the OnePlus 3. Pixel density is high enough to mask any jaggedness around text and icons, which leaves you with sharp images and vivid colours. We found that the ‘Dark’ theme with neon green accents looks best on such a panel. Colour temperature is still on the cooler side, just like with the old model, but you can fix this to an extent in the screen calibration settings. Even with the temperature slider all the way to the ‘Warm’ end, colours still seem a bit off - but it’s not as bad as it was on the OnePlus 3.

"The UK wasn’t leaving the EU, Toblerones were still proper triangles and the cheesy Wotsit Trump wasn’t filling the US government with villains that wouldn’t look out of place in an Avengers movie.
Just in case OnePlus tried to save a few pennies by using lower-quality parts this time around, we also dug into memory and storage speeds. True to form, OnePlus has actually made some improvements. RAM is now an eyeball-melting 16870MB/s quick, up from 15624MB/s in the OnePlus 3.
Next up, let’s deal with what looks like the most important change: the battery. The OnePlus 3T has a 3410mAh cell, a nice chunk bigger than the OnePlus 3’s 3000mAh.
The camera on the back is the same, apart from a new Sapphire glass coating. It's harder and pricier than the one used before, and the improved software video stabilisation that now works with 4K capture too.
It’s a 5.5in, 1080p AMOLED screen with typically slightly ripe colours, good sharpness and great contrast.
While there’s a custom interface pasted on top of Android here, the aim is to make it look a lot like the normal Android, just with more customisation on tap.
Just like last time around, the camera is pure joy to use, too. It’s quick, the app puts the basics right at your fingertips and doesn’t crowd you with silly extras you’ll use once and then forget about for the next two years.
By now you should have the sense that the OnePlus 3T is mostly just like the OnePlus 3, but costs a bit more. To hammer that home, all of the hardware finishing touches that help to define a OnePlus phone are identical.

The speaker sits on the bottom, for example, and goes pretty loud. It compares fairly well with most other high-end phones in that while it won’t touch a good Bluetooth speaker for sound quality, it won’t make you cringe at max volume either.

Its finger scanner is unchanged too, sitting below the screen and ready to react super-quick as long as your finger isn’t too wet.

The OnePlus 3T also has the same clever silencer switch as the OnePlus 3. The 3-way metal flicker on the left side lets you switch between full-on silent mode, one that just lets through priority notifications and the standard “anything goes” mode.
It’s not stripped back to the bone, though. There’s slo-mo video, panorama, an excellent auto HDR mode you’ll probably use 24/7, and a few extras that’ll please the real photo nuts.

First, there’s HQ mode, which you can use instead of HDR. This is great for use in low light as it maxes out detail capture to net you alarmingly good night shots. The amount of detail you get from this £400 phone is fantastic.

A lot of this is down to the great camera stabilisation, but HQ also uses much less image smoothing and noise reduction to make super-fine details clearer.

It gets you the functional benefits of shooting DSLR nerd-style RAW files, without ending up with files you can only in certain software packages: perfecto.

If you want to take on even more control, there’s a good manual mode that lets you set things like shutter speed, focus and white balance.

The OnePlus 3T has an excellent all-round main camera, but it doesn’t have any of the next-generation tech you’ll see in a few phones that cost £200 more. We’re talking primarily about the dual-camera antics of the Huawei Mate 9 and iPhone 7 Plus, which let you zoom in without the usual instant degradation in image quality.

That price caveat is important, though. Are you willing to pay the extra for higher-quality zoom?

You can fiddle with the size of icons, get rid of the Google search bar, make a downward swipe anywhere on the screen bring down the notification tray, and more. There are loads of little tweaks to be found if you mine the menus.

Unless it’s in some dark alcove of the OnePlus 3T we’ve not discovered yet, it seems like you can’t cram extra columns of icons into the interface anymore, but we’ve never seen any OnePlus owners use this option anyway.

Right now the 3T runs Android 6.0.1 rather than the latest Android N, so you don’t get Google’s fancy new notification system or real multi-tasking. However, you’d be silly to let that put you off a purchase given the update is going to arrive at some point.

The OnePlus 3T also feels fast, as you’d hope given the OnePlus 3 does too. It’s still one of just a few phone lines to have 6GB RAM, so you can expect that to be the case for ages to come. Despite some interface-tweaking updates since the OnePlus 3’s release, the two phones feel almost identical in use.

The difference? Without any tweaks our OnePlus 3T has a slightly warmer tone and the brightness curve is not the same, but some of that is down to the software, and it’s generally the case that different batches of phones can have slightly different colour styles.

You can also radically alter the tone, setting it to the much less colour-saturated sRGB, or customise the colour temperature without taming the colours.

The big news is up front, though. OnePlus has upgraded the selfie camera from an 8MP sensor to a 16MP one. As with the battery, though, the results aren’t quite as amazing as you might hope.

Despite the lower resolution, in a lot of conditions the older selfie camera actually renders more fine detail, particularly in beardy fuzz and eyebrows. The OnePlus 3T’s selfies are smoother and in certain conditions less noisy, but if you’re hoping for loads more detail you simply don’t get it.

The OnePlus 3T uses a Samsung 3P8SP front camera while the older OnePlus 3 has a pretty decent Sony IMX179, used as the main camera in the classic Nexus 5. Samsung’s one is much newer and much higher-res, but it frankly doesn’t seem flat-out better.

We setup a bit of a stamina obstacle course to see whether there’s really much of a difference, starting with a movie, and then 3D gaming for a more demanding test.

The results are disappointing. Sorry, everyone. Two hours of playing a video stored on the internal storage lopped 15 per cent off the OnePlus 3 battery and 17 per cent off the OnePlus 3T. That’s right, the new phone’s battery seems to drain faster.

We then gave them another blast back up to 100 per cent charge using the super-quick Dash charger and set them to run Real Racing 3 for 30 minutes. Yet again, the result wasn’t as hoped, with the OnePlus 3T ending up with 85 per cent charge and the OnePlus 3 87.

With current software at least, it looks like the OnePlus 3T lasts slightly less long than the OnePlus 3. However, part of this may come down to a tightening-up of how the newer phone reports exactly how much battery has left. That’s our only hope.

Either way, using the phone normally rather than as part of a weird stamina drag race, its longevity is very similar to the OnePlus 3’s: you’ll get a full day as long as you don’t hammer the phone too hard.

A new, slightly scary world demands a new phone, but thankfully OnePlus hasn’t gone all alt-right on us with the 3T. This is just a OnePlus 3 with a few extras - but that also means the price has gone up from £329 to £399.

Are those extras worth the £70 extra? In all honesty, no. But when the pound’s bellyflop i
to a vat of boiling oil likely dissolved OnePlus’s profit margin despite the price hike of the OnePlus 3, we can’t really complain.

This phone loses some of the stone cold bargain status of the now-discontinued OnePlus 3, but at £200 less than some rivals, it’s an easy 5-star verdict for this classy Android.

Update 26/05/2017: OnePlus has discontinued the 3T in the runup to the launch of its new flagship, the OnePlus 5. That means no new stock is being made, but you might be able to snap up one of the last few if you hurry. With more powerful hardware and a dual rear camera, the OnePlus 5 is likely to cost quite a bit more than the 3T does now, so this could be your last chance to grab a OnePlus bargain.
Arriving less than half a year after the OnePlus 3, the 3T seems as premature as Christmas decorations in September. So how's it any different?

At first glance you won’t notice any at all, apart from the new gun metal color. It’s still slim, all-aluminium and a real looker that can sit next to £600 phones without looking even remotely cheap. Just like last time.

You really have to dig to find the changes, like those tasty bits of brownie in a tub of Ben & Jerrys. First, the OnePlus 3T has a new Snapdragon 821 CPU. The last version had a Snapdragon 820, and this one is just a tad faster (10 per cent according to chip chef Qualcomm).

Will you notice the difference day-to-day? Of course not, but Geekbench 4 shows there is at least a real change. The OnePlus 3T scores 4398 points (1899 per core), the OnePlus 3 4012. That’s an increase of between 9-10 per cent, just as promised.
