It does everything really  really well  and while it may not truly excel in areas such as screen resolution and camera quality  the OnePlus 3T is still astonishingly good value for what is a serious flagship contender,"['screen', 'camera']"
  In the run up to the OnePlus 3T launch there were several reports suggesting the new phone would drop the AMOLED screen technology used on the OnePlus 3 in favor of a LCD screen   luckily that didn t happen,"['screen', 'screen']"
 Tap the app drawer icon in the dock at the bottom of the display and you ll find a vertically scrolling list of all your installed applications   of which very few come preinstalled,['display']
   With a heap of power under the hood  a full HD AMOLED display  a larger 128GB storage option and a headphone jack  the OnePlus 3T comes well equipped for music  movies and gaming,"['display', 'storage']"
 The OnePlus 3T sports Qualcomm s Snapdragon 821 chipset   that s the same chip you ll find in the Google Pixel and Pixel XL   and with 6GB of RAM providing ample support this is a serious power player,['ram']
  The most welcome addition to the OnePlus 3T over the OnePlus 3 is the bigger battery,['battery']
  On the rear of the OnePlus 3T nothing has changed over the OnePlus 3  with the same Sony made 16MP rear camera protruding from the metal uni body  and a single LED flash sitting below it,['camera']
   The big difference in the camera department here is round the front,['camera']
   While the OnePlus 3T is an improvement over the handset you re holding in your hand right now   the battery life is the standout upgrade   it s difficult to justify trading in for the newer model,['battery']
   The OnePlus 3T improves on the OnePlus 3 in several key areas  notably improved battery life and slicker performance,['battery']
  Some will point to the lack of expandable storage as a stumbling block  while its larger size rules it out for those wanting something a little more manageable in the hand,['storage']
    It does everything really  really well  and while it may not truly excel in areas such as screen resolution and camera quality  the OnePlus 3T is still astonishingly good value for what is a serious flagship contender,"['screen', 'camera']"
  OnePlus  reasoning for bumping up this camera is to appeal to the Facebook Live Snapchat selfie generation   and if you fall into this category you ll likely be impressed,['camera']
  The OnePlus 3T s camera provides a solid showing in most situations  while it s not quite up there with the newest iPhones or Samsungs you could do a lot worse than this snapper,['camera']
   Images can look a little darker   especially in low light   compared to those from the competition  but OnePlus says it s engineered its camera this way to give a result that s truer to what your eyes see in the same scenario  instead of brightening up dark areas artificially,['camera']
    Fire up the camera app and it s more of the same from OnePlus  with a relatively clean interface giving you control over HDR  high dynamic range  and HQ  high quality  modes,['camera']
18 with the battery at 65  to see just how fast Dash charging is,['battery']
  We ran the TechRadar 90 minute Full HD video test on the OnePlus 3T  with screen brightness at max  Wi Fi connected and accounts syncing in the background,['screen']
  It means battery capacity has increased from 3 000mAh in the OnePlus 3 to 3 400mAh in the 3T   and it shows,['battery']
   Video playback is also great on the OnePlus 3T  with the Full HD display providing clear visuals and bright colors   although it doesn t have quite the same clarity as the QHD resolution displays of the Galaxy S7 Edge  HTC 10 and LG G5,['display']
    There s a new wallpaper  the  clear all  button in the multi tasking menu is bigger  circular and centralized  and the screen brightness slider in the notification bar now has a toggle for auto brightness,['screen']
 Swipe down from the top of the display and the notification panel offers a range of editable quick settings and a screen brightness slider,"['display', 'screen']"
  One of the main upgrades in the OnePlus 3T is on screen performance  with the Chinese firm claiming it s faster than the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 thanks to the new chipset stuffed inside,['screen']
  This allowed the OnePlus 3T to maintain the same slim profile and bright  vibrant display,['display']
  What that means is text  images and video are clear and smooth   although the display lacks the supreme clarity of the QHD toting LG G6 and Galaxy S8,['display']
35mm   same aluminum uni body  same rear camera protrusion  same factory fitted  but removable  screen protector ,"['camera', 'screen']"
  That s up from the  399   329  around AU 450  for the OnePlus 3   but there was another storage price option with the OnePlus 3T,['storage']
   OnePlus introduced a new 128GB storage option for its fourth generation flagship  which set you back  479    439  around AU 630    it s a move that will likely delight some users  with the firm continuing to shun expandable memory features such as a microSD slot,"['storage', 'memory']"
   That means you re getting slicker performance  longer battery life  a punchier selfie snapper and a new storage option   at a slightly higher price,"['battery', 'storage']"
   The 3T wasn t a completely new phone   even OnePlus admits that  instead billing it as new variant of the 3  and too right   the OnePlus 3T has the same design  screen  RAM  rear camera and fingerprint scanner as the phone it s shoving out of the limelight,"['screen', 'ram', 'camera']"
 As a result  you get a 4x5 grid over the previous 4x4 one  and icons are able to make much better use of the phone s screen,['screen']
 Turn the OnePlus 3T over and you ll see a moderate camera bump from the protruding rear camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
5 inch screen is on paper identical to the OnePlus 3 s,['screen']
 You can also customise how the Home screen looks and performs,['screen']
 If you want  swiping up anywhere on the Home screen can open search  or swiping down from anywhere opens the notification panel so you don t have to drag from the top,['screen']
 Paired with 6GB of DDR4 RAM it s unsurprising that the OnePlus 3T feels incredibly snappy,['ram']
 OnePlus hasn t changed the rear facing camera from the OnePlus 3,['camera']
 Camera performance compared to the OnePlus 3 hasn t changed a great deal  and the OIS helps to maintain less blurry shots under low light,['camera']
 Performance from the rear camera overall is still great for the money  although not quite as amazing as when the OnePlus 3 launched at  309  which then subsequently increased post Brexit ,['camera']
 The OIS helps the camera to produce sharp shots The original OnePlus 3 had a habit of producing smeared skin tones  whereas the OnePlus 3T looks less like the lens has been coated in vaseline and produces generally sharper results,['camera']
 For the narcissists out there  the selfie camera upgrade is a decent improvement,['camera']
 OnePlus has upgraded the battery to 3 400mAh over the 3 000mAh in the OnePlus 3,['battery']
 The OnePlus 3T remains the best Android phone you can buy in its price category with fantastic performance  great build quality and an improved battery life  but now that it s edged towards  400 and beyond  it s not quite as big a bargain as its predecessor,['battery']
com oneplus 3t review battery life and verdict page 4 PsLRm2bfMGSFJOdo,['battery']
 The fact that the display isn t Quad HD no doubt helps with its battery performance,"['display', 'battery']"
 An hour of Netflix streaming with the display set to 60  brightness also only saw a drop of 9   which is very good,['display']
 Half an hour of Asphalt 8 took the battery down 7 ,['battery']
  A bigger change has been made to the front facing camera  which now uses a 16 megap l Samsung 3P8SP sensor and an F 2,['camera']
  Other OnePlus 3 camera features like the dynamic de noise and Auto HDR return,['camera']
 Even with the latter engaged  which only operates under ideal scenarios  there s no shutter lag and the Camera app responds well,['camera']
 OnePlus says the 6GB of RAM is actually used for the Camera app to help boost its responsiveness,"['ram', 'camera']"
  OnePlus   Shelf  makes a return  which is accessible by swiping right on the Home screen,['screen']
 This houses your recent contacts  recent apps and a management centre that shows your storage and battery levels  as well as how much data you have left if you re on a limited tariff,"['storage', 'battery']"
 Out of the box colours are a little oversaturated but the display looks great and in truth  this is how I left the display during most of my testing,"['display', 'display']"
 This makes the display a little less harsh on your eyes in the dark as well as supposedly reducing the impact on your circadian rhythm,['display']
  Like the Moto Z  there s also an Ambient Display that turns the display on in a low power mode when notifications come in  as well as Proximity Wake that turns on the display when you wave your hand over the camera,"['display', 'display', 'display', 'camera']"
  The Optic AMOLED tech means black levels are superb and the display still looks super sharp  regardless of its comparably low pixels per inch count,['display']
 The second SIM slot does not double as a microSD card slot  as is the case with certain other phones  so there s no expandable storage  just like the OnePlus 3,['storage']
 The extra for 128GB isn t a complete rip off compared to what others have charged for extra storage  either,['storage']
  The button setup is similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 s  and means you can do away with Android s on screen navigation buttons  freeing up more of the display,"['screen', 'display']"
 You can still turn on the on screen navigation in the settings if you want,['screen']
99  Key changes include a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor  13  larger battery capacity and improved front facing camera,"['processor', 'battery', 'camera']"
  On the One lus 3T  you bring the recent apps carousel up but hold one of the open app cards and drag it to one side of the screen,['screen']
  Battery life has also held up  and I can still easily last a day without worrying about carrying a charger with me,['battery']
 Everything s now had a lick of blue paint and you get a bit of contextual information for each settings section  such as how much duration you can expect from the battery,['battery']
 For some  the new selfie camera  slightly faster chipset  bigger battery and a new color don t justify the extra  40  but for others   the price hike feels inevitable as OnePlus grows to the status of an established manufacturers and begins offering a higher quality service,"['camera', 'battery']"
 We can t fail to mention that the bigger battery pack not only came at no expense in terms of volume  but weight as well,['battery']
 That is some advanced battery magic  if we ever saw some,['battery']
 Just like the OnePlus 3  the only little beef we have with the  T  variant and we doubt it is universally shared is the camera bump,['camera']
 Besides the subjective aesthetics of the phone  when left on a flat surface  the main concern with this is scratches to the camera lens,['camera']
 When the display is off it blends in with the surrounding almost perfectly,['display']
 So  the wow factor is still there despite the lack of a curved display,['display']
 In the typical company fashion  users are offered a full range of navigation customization options  including the choice between on screen controls and the capacitive touch buttons,['screen']
 Sure  the diamond pentile pixel arrangement isn t the best possible choice  but the screen more than makes up for that with its great contrast,['screen']
 Along with the choice of screen resolution  color accuracy was another big point over which the OnePlus 3 was criticized,['screen']
 Changing gears quickly  as if to wash away the minor USB disappointment  the 3 400 mAh battery in the OnePlus 3T is quite the engineering feat,['battery']
 The most impressive thing about it is that the extra battery capacity doesn t come at the expense of neither added weight nor volume,['battery']
 This is a solid achievement by the OnePlus 3  as it does have a smaller battery than its predecessors,['battery']
 While the screen is still off  there are also quite a few gestures to enjoy,['screen']
 For instance  draw O for the camera  draw V to toggle the flashlight on off  or draw     for previous next track,['camera']
 Swiping left or right will fire up the dialer or the camera,['camera']
 As for the toggles  they include Wi Fi  Bluetooth  Night Mode  Airplane mode  screen auto rotate  flashlight  location on off and a few others,['screen']
 Of course  you can also adjust the brightness of the screen and go into the settings menu,['screen']
 Some aspects of this hardware refresh are a little bit more visible than others  like the new 128GB storage option or the higher megapixel front camera,"['storage', 'camera']"
 The RAM interface frequency and maximum bandwidth has also been increased from 1333 MHz or 21,['ram']
 This should effectively shrink the storage performance difference between the pair,['storage']
 On paper  the OnePlus 3T main camera is yet another department  which OnePlus decided to carry over from the vanilla sibling,['camera']
 This is a good thing too since both phones offer a solid camera experience,['camera']
 The camera utilizes the same Sony IMX298 sensor  which is not Sony s cutting edge offer but is still good enough to power some other excellent flagship cameras  like the Xiaomi Mi 5 and the Huawei Mate 8,['camera']
 Regarding image quality  the OnePlus 3T may have the same camera hardware as the OnePlus 3 but it comes with a new factory tuning,['camera']
 In camera sharpening is more prominent now,['camera']
 We also appreciate the on screen notification whenever Auto HDR kicks in,['screen']
 This way you are always clear exactly what the camera app is doing,['camera']
 The HQ toggle in the camera app does just that   it enables some additional enhancement algorithms that try to recover some of the finer detail that might have gone missing,['camera']
 As previously mentioned  the new 16MP front facing camera is a great performer,['camera']
5 inch  QHD  AMOLED panel  Snapdragon 820 SoC  4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage,"['ram', 'storage']"
 However  if you go for the ZTE  you will be sacrificing some of the perceivable brand coolness  along with a fair bit of battery capacity and a truly decluttered software experience,['battery']
 The pricing is right and so are the internals   Snapdragon 820  4GB to 6GB of RAM and 64GB to 128GB of storage,"['ram', 'storage']"
 In fact  this is probably the camera s biggest weakness,['camera']
  The camera offers consistent performance and most of the time it just worked,['camera']
  Other more obscure settings such as geotagging  preferred storage and the shutter sound are all hidden away in the settings menu,['storage']
 There is even RAW support that saves files alongside the compressed ones  so the camera is undoubtedly full featured,['camera']
  The 16MP camera has a 1,['camera']
  As for the selfie camera  OnePlus has decided to offer an upgrade,['camera']
 The simple 8MP camera in the OnePlus 3 has been swapped for a 16MP one in the OnePlus 3T,['camera']
  But let s start by telling you more about the camera UI,['camera']
 The default camera app is based on the stock Android solution and is about as straightforward and streamlined as it gets,['camera']
  That being said  however  mobile camera capabilities have come a long way  especially in the last few months  so what we are trying to say is that perhaps the camera of the OnePlus 3T is not competitive today as it was on the OnePlus 3,"['camera', 'camera']"
0 NAND storage chips,['storage']
 We already mentioned that Oxygen OS lets you easily chose between using the phone s capacitive keys or on screen controls for navigation,['screen']
 Naturally  this eats through your resources  battery and potentially data plan behind the scenes,['battery']
 This is not bad in itself  but the way you increase said space is to click and hold the last widget until a very odd slider looking thing appears on screen,['screen']
 On the technical side of things  this is achieved through a clever segmentation system  which allows the sub parts of the battery to be charged independently in parallel  Oppo s VOOC charging ,['battery']
 30 minutes on the charger consistently got us from a dead battery up to 60 ,['battery']
 Not only that but 60  in 30 minutes was valid both for the OnePlus 3 and the new  T  variant  despite the difference in battery capacity,['battery']
 The image does look a bit bland in this mode  so if the punchy screen is what you are after  then the default mode can deliver plenty of that,['screen']
 Plus  there is the battery life benefit of using the lower screen resolution  and with OpenGL ES 3,"['battery', 'screen']"
 Sadly  neither of the slots would take a microSD card and it is sad to see OnePlus skimping on expandable storage altogether,['storage']
 But then again  there is a new 128GB storage option on offer this time around,['storage']
 It has the camera bump in question and a single LED flash below it,['camera']
 OnePlus advertises a zero to 60  charge of the 3400mAh battery in just 30 minutes and to our surprise  we actually managed to get pretty close to those numbers,['battery']
5in screen phone slim  svelte and usable with one hand  just ,['screen']
 Despite initial rumours  the OnePlus 3T has exactly the same display as the OnePlus 3,['display']
 By its own admission  OnePlus continues to ship a screen that recreates colours more vibrantly than most  but with the Oxygen OS skin of Android that it runs this feels right  the handset and feel of the software that the screen runs is right at home with the popping colours and bright whites,"['screen', 'screen']"
 We ve used the OnePlus 3 for a few months  so can draw decent comparisons   straight off  you need not upgrade for fear of missing out on processor power  speed or battery life if you own the older model,"['processor', 'battery']"
 The OnePlus 3T is available with 64GB of internal storage  but bear in mind there s no SD card slot,['storage']
 The fact you only need to spend  30 more to get an impressive 128GB shows you that Apple charging  100 more for that jump in storage for the iPhone 7 is unnecessarily high,['storage']
 The non removable battery clocks in at 3 400mAh  a step up from the 3 000 of the OnePlus 3,['battery']
 The internals are exactly the same dimensions but the battery is denser  hence the increase,['battery']
 On one particularly busy Google Maps day out in Barcelona even after 12 hours on the go the battery was sitting at 15   and that was with the phone used to navigate  take photos and video and more besides,['battery']
 The slim casing of the 3T means the camera protrudes slightly,['camera']
 We used the camera extensively in Barcelona  and the results were very impressive,['camera']
 The front facing 16Mp camera is an upgrade on the 8Mp of the OnePlus 3  and is one of the highest resolution selfie cameras on the market  matching as it does the megapixel count of the rear one,['camera']
 The OnePlus 3T may have  on paper  a better processor  bigger battery and better selfie camera but if you own the 3  it isn t worth spending another  400 for those features,"['processor', 'battery', 'camera']"
  However  if you want 128GB on board storage  you ll have to go for the OnePlus 3T  setting you back  439,['storage']
 It has a bigger battery  lightning fast speeds and a selfie camera that means video calls are actually worthwhile experiences,"['battery', 'camera']"
The OnePlus 3 has  like the newer 3T  6GB RAM and come December will also run Android Nougat,['ram']
 You can just about tell the battery life is better though  but it was already excellent on the OnePlus 3,['battery']
 Don t panic   you don t need to upgrade unless you want a OnePlus phone with 128GB of storage,['storage']
 To be honest  they are minor changes  like the layout of the notification bar that you pull down from the top of the screen,['screen']
 A football match in cloudy weather was reproduced well with no blur and in a low lit church the camera reproduced colour and shadow to a high quality level,['camera']
 This was when using the device as our primary email sender and using apps like Slack  Spotify  Pocket  WhatsApp  train timetable apps  GPS battery drainers like Google Maps and several others throughout the day,['battery']
 The battery percentage chugs down at the expected rate  and we didn t experience any dramatic unexpected fall off,['battery']
 It joins the Google Pixel and Pixel XL in having Qualcomm s top of the line Snapdragon 821 processor  the current pinnacle of smartphone chips,['processor']
 It is truly like using a desktop at some times  and even has more RAM than some of those computers with 6GB on board,['ram']
 XDA Developers accuses OnePlus of having configured the processor to automatically switch into overdrive mode when a popular benchmark is detected  you can read the full story here ,['processor']
 OnePlus has confirmed the practice and apologised  stating that  In order to give users a better user experience in resource intensive apps and games  especially graphically intensive ones  we implemented certain mechanisms in the community and Nougat builds to trigger the processor to run more aggressively,['processor']
 In that box it also already comes with a screen protector pre applied  handy if you want to use it with one,['screen']
 The only lines that break the dark gunmetal of our review unit are the aerial lines and the OnePlus logo that sits beneath a 16Mp camera that protrudes ever so slightly from the casing,['camera']
 The front facing camera sits next to the earpiece and is also an amazing 16Mp  something we ll explore later,['camera']
 It is sold with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM  and priced at  479   479 and  439,"['storage', 'ram']"
 The gunmetal version comes with both 64 and 128 GB options  while the gold iteration only comes with 64 GB of on board storage,['storage']
 Things remain unchanged on the display side  with the OnePlus 3T also coming with a 5,['display']
5 inch AMOLED display with a 1080p resolution,['display']
 As is expected from an AMOLED screen  you get rich and vibrant colors with a lot of contrast  and the optional dark mode that is built in to Oxygen OS takes fanastic advantage of the deep inky blacks,['screen']
 If you aren t a fan of the vibrancy though  it is also easy to switch to a sRGB color mode in the Display Settings that provides a more natural and less saturated look,['display']
 Under the hood  the OnePlus 3T comes with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor  clocked at 2,['processor']
 The 3T retains the 6 GB of RAM that is also available with the OnePlus 3,['ram']
 With 6 GB of RAM  multitasking isn t an issue either  and you can have a lot of apps in running the background and keep them for a very long time,['ram']
 As mentioned  64 GB and 128 GB are the internal storage options available  but if storage is a concern  users will have to opt for the higher variant  with expandable storage via microSD card not being available,"['storage', 'storage', 'storage']"
 Another area where the OnePlus 3T has received an upgrade is in the battery department  with the device coming with a 3 400 mAh battery  which is a slight bump when compared to the 3 000 mAh unit available with the OnePlus 3,"['battery', 'battery']"
 The 13  bump in battery capacity is more impressive when you consider the fact that OnePlus was able to achieve it without making the phone any heavier or thicker than its namesake,['battery']
 OnePlus claims that you can get a full day of battery life after charging the device for just half an hour,['battery']
 As far as the battery life is concerned  the overall experience has been extremely good,['battery']
 So  while this bump in battery capacity may seem small  it seems to make a significant difference to the battery life,"['battery', 'battery']"
 The final area that has seen an upgrade from the OnePlus 3 is with the camera  but this change is more focused on the front facing shooter  which is now a 16 MP unit  which is double the 8 MP sensor that was found with the OnePlus 3,['camera']
 The rear camera is the same 16 MP unit that was available with the OnePlus 3  and  comes with a f 2,['camera']
 The default camera app is pretty similar to the Google Camera  with many of the same modes to be found here  including Timelapse  Slow motion  and Panorama,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The only exception is that manual controls are available if you are looking to dial in the setting yourself  but it is otherwise a very nicely laid out and easy to use camera application,['camera']
 In terms of dynamic range  the camera does have a tendency to overexpose the shot and blow out a lot of the highlights  but HDR mode alleviates this problem easily,['camera']
 A few new customization options have been added to the latest version of the Oxygen OS  such as a built in night mode  that makes the viewing the screen easier on your eyes at night,['screen']
 There are custom accent colors  support for third party icon packs  and the screen off gestures like double tap to wake  or the ability to launch the camera or flashlight by drawing on O or a V on the screen,"['screen', 'camera', 'screen']"
 The faster processor  an improved front facing camera  and larger battery capacity also results in a bump in the price point  with the 64 GB model priced at  439  and the 128 GB iteration setting you back an additional  40,"['processor', 'camera', 'battery']"
 You can now swipe down on the screen with three fingers to take a screenshot  and add a password or use your fingerprint to lock down any application,['screen']
  Shelf is still accessible by swiping to the left of the home screen  and holds a lot of information  including the weather info and your recent contacts or used apps,['screen']
 You can also compose memos and manage your data  storage  and battery life  and there any widget can be added here  instead of having them take up space on the other home screens,"['storage', 'battery']"
  This is definitely a good camera with it comes to picture quality,['camera']
  The front facing camera also comes with an f 2,['camera']
  Not surprisingly  the performance is absolutely fantastic with the OnePlus 3T  with the comparatively lower resolution display a contributing factor as well,['display']
 Sharpness isn t a problem either  and to the naked eye  the difference between this 1080p panel and other Quad HD screen won t be noticeable  unless you are using the phone for VR,['screen']
 OnePlus feels that VR isn t mainstream enough to justify the jump to Quad HD  and decided to stick to 1080p to aid with the battery life,['battery']
5 inch display,['display']
 As the OnePlus 3T has the same screen as the OnePlus 3  there is no deviance here from the earlier device,['screen']
 The device is bright and has vivid colours  and like the OnePlus 3  has a dual polarizing layer designed to make the phone s screen easier to see in the brightest daylight,['screen']
 This does make the device more user friendly   especially when compared to other Android devices   and has elements such as on screen buttons to take you back and to the homepage alongside resized app icons to make the phone look cleaner and more uniform,['screen']
 Although this left a significant amount of storage for our own apps  pictures and so on  we were staggered at how much the default files took up,['storage']
 That said  when the OnePlus 3T 128GB version costs  439  compared to the 128GB iPhone 7 which costs  699  you still get a lot of storage for you money,['storage']
 By comparison  the iPhone 7 s front camera is 7MP  with a 12MP back camera while the iPhone 7 Plus has 12MP cameras front and back  meaning the OnePlus 3T stands up against these devices,"['camera', 'camera']"
 In particular  the OnePlus 3T offers fantastic camera options at a cheaper price point than the P9,['camera']
 This means the phone has faster processing speeds and greater efficiency but still uses the same battery consumption as Snapdragon 820,['battery']
 The phone receives 60 per cent charge for the 3 400 mAh battery  which is an improvement on the 3 s 3000 mAh  in 30 minutes which is great when you don t have the time to wait around for you phone to fully charge,['battery']
 The boosted battery has also had its capacity increased by 13 per cent  while keeping the phone the same weight and volume as the 3,['battery']
 The OnePlus 3T is merely a continuation of this  with some better features such as the improved front camera and battery  but overall it hasn t deviated much from the design of the earlier device,"['camera', 'battery']"
 The size of the screen is great  the improved camera is a plus and compared to other Android devices  it is relatively straightforward to use,"['screen', 'camera']"
 Particularly as other brands like Samsung have had significant difficulties with charging phones  it is good to see a brand like OnePlus creating a faster battery whilst also ensuring it is safe for its users,['battery']
  Again  like the OnePlus 3  it features 6GB of LPDDR4 Ram to make the handset function faster,['ram']
  Also  you can see the date and time on the phone by simply holding your hand over the screen,['screen']
  Again  like the OnePlus 3  the OnePlus 3T s rear camera is covered by a protective layer of sapphire glass to prevent it from scratching,['camera']
  An added benefit of the 16MP front camera means it produces clearer photos and video  even in low light situations,['camera']
 The rear camera uses a 16MP Sony PDAF sensor with f,['camera']
 By pressing the hollow square on the screen  it brings up all the open apps,['screen']
  Like the OnePlus 3  the OnePlus 3T ships with a pre installed Gorilla Glass 4 screen protector which is a welcome addition,['screen']
 When you re spending a lot of money on a device  sometimes over  700  extra protection for a screen is always a nice perk,['screen']
  However  this protector smudges very easily  much more so than other smartphone screen protectors we have used  and this can make the phone appear dirty and used even when it s new,['screen']
 The screen benefits from the phone s thin bezel  though again  this is no different to the OnePlus 3,['screen']
 There s a solitary OnePlus logo stamped on the back  bookended by iPhone and HTC like antenna breaks  and a slightly raised camera lens,['camera']
 The primary change between the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T is the replacement of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 with the newer and more powerful Snapdragon 821 processor,['processor']
 The RAM remains the same at 6GB  and although there are a few other alterations  the chip swap is undoubtedly the main reason why the 3T is more expensive,['ram']
 The OnePlus 3T has the same 16 megapixel camera as the OnePlus 3,['camera']
 Around the front  the OnePlus 3T has a 16 megapixel selfie camera,['camera']
 It s great  and even in low light   when the camera combines pixels to artificially boost the light   it does well,['camera']
 Even though the OnePlus 3T has the same dimensions as the OnePlus 3  it contains a larger capacity 3 400mAh battery  which we found to last about a day with moderately heavy use,['battery']
 You can elongate battery life even further  using the battery saver  which turns off location  background data  and the vibrate feature,"['battery', 'battery']"
 One thing we do like is the chance to display the battery icon as a circle and not a bar,"['display', 'battery']"
  The Dash Charge fast charging system is back  and OnePlus claims it will charge the battery to 60 percent capacity in just 30 minutes,['battery']
  Depending on which model you buy  you can get either 64GB or 128GB of internal memory  but sadly there s no MicroSD card slot to increase your storage,"['memory', 'storage']"
 OnePlus decided not to go for one of the new dual SIM trays that has the option of using one of the slots for a memory card  so the 3T is a strictly dual SIM device,['memory']
 The most noticeable is Shelf  which slides in from the left of the home screen  where you can find shortcuts to frequently used apps  space for Android widgets  the weather  and a space to write memos,['screen']
 The OnePlus 3T runs cooler when under pressure than the 3  and the increased power efficiency offered by the Snapdragon 821 means the larger capacity 3 400mAh battery will last even longer,['battery']
5 inch Optic AMOLED screen with a 1 920 x 1 080 pixel resolution,['screen']
 If it s too stark  under a Screen Calibration setting  there s an eye pleasing sRGB option  and a custom setting with a warm to cool slider,['screen']
 The screen is highly reflective  and the brightness never elevates itself to a high enough level for super visibility,['screen']
 The bezels around the screen are slim  but it doesn t have the bezel less display that s now a feature on premium phones like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6,"['screen', 'display']"
5D Gorilla Glass 4 covers the screen  completing the slick modern design,['screen']
 The OnePlus 3T goes in at  399 for the 64GB model  or  439 for the 128GB model   that s an important distinction  because unlike other Android smartphones  there is no expandable memory here,['memory']
 So  what do you get for the money  There are three main improvements  processor  battery life and camera,"['processor', 'battery', 'camera']"
 Finally  there s the camera  although if you were expecting big improvements to the main camera  you ll be disappointed,"['camera', 'camera']"
 Although the rear camera gets a tougher sapphire lens cover  the main camera improvements I mentioned in the introduction are reserved for the front facing selfie camera  which captures images now a whopping 16 megapixels in resolution,"['camera', 'camera', 'camera']"
 Typically  I d discuss the design and display at this point  but since they re the same as the OnePlus 3  I ll cut straight to the chase and get stuck into performance,['display']
  Along with the processor upgrade  the OnePlus 3T inherits its predecessor s impressive list of core specifications,['processor']
 Namely  that Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 is backed up by 6GB of RAM and includes Qualcomm s Adreno 530 graphics processing unit,['ram']
 But what about the extra battery life  Well  the 3 400mAh should indeed give us more life  but weirdly in our standard test  a looped 720p video viewed at 170cd m2 brightness in airplane mode   it actually fared worse than the original OnePlus 3   lasting just 13hrs 22mins  compared with the OnePlus 3 s 16hrs 56mins,['battery']
 Sometimes day to day use brings up markedly different results to our battery tests  however  and anecdotally I m actually experiencing slightly better battery life than with the OnePlus 3,"['battery', 'battery']"
 While it s true we were able to jump from 49  to 92  battery in 30 minutes  it took another 24 minutes to hit 100    not everyone would find 43  capacity enough to get them through a day   especially if they re a power user,['battery']
 Briefly  because we ve already covered the OnePlus 3T s main camera in the OnePlus 3 review  it s good,['camera']
 Now back to the familiar stuff that s identical to the last model   the design and the display,['display']
 And for normal  non VR  usage  the OnePlus 3T s screen is just fine,['screen']
 Switched to sRGB mode and the screen covers 93,['screen']
 It s faster  and it has a bigger battery,['battery']
5   it remains a big beast of a phone  albeit one that doesn t quite feel like a phablet   and that screen is still an AMOLED 1 080 x 1 920 panel,['screen']
 On a screen this size  anything over 1080p is tough to tell apart from its supposedly sharper QHD and 4K rivals,['screen']
  So  by bringing the front facing camera up to the same 16 megapixels  you can expect that level of performance from your selfies  right  Wrong,['camera']
  Then there s the battery,['battery']
 The OnePlus 3T also seems to have a brighter display  which is evident when the two phones are placed side by side,['display']
 The general app and system performance of OnePlus 3T is incredibly fluid as you always have about 4GB of RAM that s at your disposal,['ram']
 The generous amount of onboard storage also means you never have to worry about running out of space  even if you re a compulsive media user,['storage']
 OnePlus 3T s front camera is the second biggest change compared to the OnePlus 3,['camera']
 We quite liked the OnePlus 3T camera s low light performance  as images aren t too noisy and a fair bit of detail is preserved,['camera']
 On the surface  the OnePlus 3T might seem like a minor upgrade over the OnePlus 3  the key areas being the battery capacity  higher resolution front camera and the faster CPU,"['battery', 'camera']"
 However  after using it for the better part of a week  it s clear that the improvements extend to the brighter and more colour accurate display  and faster internal storage,"['display', 'storage']"
 34 999   but something like a quad HD screen for this version would have helped sealed the deal nicely,['screen']
 Low light camera performance is better and we have no reason to complain about the lack of expandable storage anymore,"['camera', 'storage']"
  The third notable change is that the OnePlus 3T has a 3400mAh battery,['battery']
    The 16 megapixel rear camera of OnePlus 3T supports PDAF  has an f 2,['camera']
 The punchy colours of the display make watching videos really enjoyable,['display']
 The display has good very good sunlight legibility too with wide viewing angles,['display']
 The camera bump remains  but you needn t worry about scratches thanks to the sapphire crystal glass,['camera']
 There s 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM and a whopping 128GB of internal storage,"['ram', 'storage']"
 34 999  but you can also get the 3T with 64GB of storage at Rs,['storage']
 Swiping right from the home screen lets you access  Shelf   a customisable screen which lets you stack widgets for quick access,"['screen', 'screen']"
5 inch AMOLED display of OnePlus 3T has the same full HD resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 4 as the OnePlus 3,['display']
 Colour temperature is still on the cooler side  just like with the old model  but you can fix this to an extent in the screen calibration settings,['screen']
 Just in case OnePlus tried to save a few pennies by using lower quality parts this time around  we also dug into memory and storage speeds,"['memory', 'storage']"
 RAM is now an eyeball melting 16870MB s quick  up from 15624MB s in the OnePlus 3,['ram']
 Next up  let s deal with what looks like the most important change  the battery,['battery']
 The camera on the back is the same  apart from a new Sapphire glass coating,['camera']
5in  1080p AMOLED screen with typically slightly ripe colours  good sharpness and great contrast,['screen']
 Just like last time around  the camera is pure joy to use  too,['camera']
  Its finger scanner is unchanged too  sitting below the screen and ready to react super quick as long as your finger isn t too wet,['screen']
  A lot of this is down to the great camera stabilisation  but HQ also uses much less image smoothing and noise reduction to make super fine details clearer,['camera']
  The OnePlus 3T has an excellent all round main camera  but it doesn t have any of the next generation tech you ll see in a few phones that cost  200 more,['camera']
 We re talking primarily about the dual camera antics of the Huawei Mate 9 and iPhone 7 Plus  which let you zoom in without the usual instant degradation in image quality,['camera']
 Are you willing to pay the extra for higher quality zoom   You can fiddle with the size of icons  get rid of the Google search bar  make a downward swipe anywhere on the screen bring down the notification tray  and more,['screen']
 It s still one of just a few phone lines to have 6GB RAM  so you can expect that to be the case for ages to come,['ram']
 OnePlus has upgraded the selfie camera from an 8MP sensor to a 16MP one,['camera']
 As with the battery  though  the results aren t quite as amazing as you might hope,['battery']
  Despite the lower resolution  in a lot of conditions the older selfie camera actually renders more fine detail  particularly in beardy fuzz and eyebrows,['camera']
  The OnePlus 3T uses a Samsung 3P8SP front camera while the older OnePlus 3 has a pretty decent Sony IMX179  used as the main camera in the classic Nexus 5,"['camera', 'camera']"
 Two hours of playing a video stored on the internal storage lopped 15 per cent off the OnePlus 3 battery and 17 per cent off the OnePlus 3T,"['storage', 'battery']"
 That s right  the new phone s battery seems to drain faster,['battery']
 However  part of this may come down to a tightening up of how the newer phone reports exactly how much battery has left,['battery']
 With more powerful hardware and a dual rear camera  the OnePlus 5 is likely to cost quite a bit more than the 3T does now  so this could be your last chance to grab a OnePlus bargain,['camera']
