"Ya hemos terminado de analizar el LG G6, un modelo al que teníamos bastantes ganas de “hincarle el diente” y que este llega con varias opciones que nos parecen atractivas tanto en un ámbito global del mercado como para la propia firma coreana. El caso, es que estamos ante un smartphone de gama alta, y que es la apuesta con la que por el momento el fabricante quiere destacar (a la espera de una evolución del LG V20). Esto es lo que nos ha parecido el análisis del LG G6.
Ahora, pasamos a comentar lo que hemos obtenido en cada uno de los apartados que solemos revisar en MovilZona y, en este análisis del LG G6 no hemos hecho una excepción con ninguno de ellos. Esperamos que os sirvan para que tengáis claro si este modelo es uno de los que creéis que más merece la pena del mercado actual.
No encontramos un diseño especialmente disruptor en el nuevo modelo. Las líneas son parecidas, que no iguales, que en el modelo al que sustituye en el mercado. Eso sí, hay detalles que se tienen que comentar para  que quede todo claro. Por ejemplo, el uso de metal y cristal queda bastante bien a simple vista (y en la mano, por cierto). Y, así, queda claro que estamos ante un móvil atractivo y que llama la atención. Por cierto, que esta vez el metal sí que es claro que está presente, lo que es positivo.
La parte delantera que hemos visto en el análisis del LG G6 muestra un aprovechamiento excepcional de esta, con una pantalla que está muy cerca del 80% -lo que está al alcance de muy pocos-. Evidentemente esto hace que los botones de control de Android estén integrados en la pantalla, lo que no es precisamente un problema. La trasera es la que incluye el cristal, y lo cierto es que resulta llamativa y, también, un imán para las huellas. Aquí está el correspondiente sensor que, a su vez, hace de botón de Encendido. Su funcionamiento es muy bueno, no tanto como los de Huawei, pero no se tendrá queja alguna a este respecto y el uso no desgasta el elemento.
En definitiva, un modelo atractivo, que pierde algunas cosas pero gana muchas más. Así, estamos a nuestro juicio ante uno de los modelos más atractivos que jamás ha lanzado la compañía al mercado, y que manejarlo es realmente cómodo y que no tiene grandes fallos. Nos ha convencido, aunque no sea el modelo más diferencial que es posible encontrar… pero no desentona con ninguno.
Este es uno de los componentes que tiene novedades importantes en el nuevo terminal que hemos probado. En el análisis del LG G6 encontramos un panel IPS -Fullvision- integrado que dispone de una resolución denominada QHD+ (2.880  x 1.440) y que le permite superar de forma muy holgada los 500 ppp de densidad de píxeles para sus dimensiones de 5,7 pulgadas. Es decir, gama alta de pura cepa. Pero lo cierto, es que uno de los añadidos es el ratio de aspecto que es de 18:9.
La importancia de este detalle es mucha para el fabricante, ya que en la presentación del MWC hicieron mucho hincapié en ello y en las bondades que ofrece, como el mejor aprovechamiento de la pantalla partida o el poder manipular los botones y accesos directos con mayor comodidad. Y, lo cierto, es que es así y se agradece. ¿Es algo completamente diferencial? Pues sí, pero lo que aporta no se debe considerar como capital (aunque bien es cierto que cuando se pasa a un modelo “tradicional” se nota). Un buen añadido, no hay duda que para los usuarios más intensivos que puede ser muy interesante.
Por cierto, un par de detalles que hay que comentar: la compatibilidad con contenidos HDR, que sacan todo el jugo al panel integrado con, aquí sí, un efecto “wow” bastante merecido. Además los bordes de la pantalla no tienen esquinas ni aristas, lo que hace que se mantenga el nuevo estilo de curvas constantes y la verdad es que permite la sensación de tener entre manos un modelo diferente y casi único. Otro acierto que descubrimos en el análisis del LG G6.
Llegamos a un apartado comprometido en este análisis del LG G6. Y esto lo decimos debido a que la evolución en lo que tiene que ver con un componente esencial no es muy elevada. Nos referimos al procesador. El integrado es un Snapdragon 821, y no se ha conseguido dar el salto al nuevo 835 (pero ni LG ni nadie por el momento). Esto puede limitar el “efecto deseo” en algunos, pero la combinación con sus 4 GB de RAM -quizá el integrar seis hubiera llamado la atención por este lado-, permite ofrecer un rendimiento excelente en líneas generales (al menos con los rivales actuales, los que lleguen en un futuro… está por ver pero las cosas no serán precisamente sencillas).
El caso es que nos ha gustado mucho la capacidad que hemos visto en el análisis del LG G6, con una personalización que no es excesivamente glotona y que aporta merma de recursos -la evolución añadida en este aspecto es de aplaudir con un respeto por Android puro mayor que nunca- y, por lo tanto, el terminal responde actualmente con lo que se espera de un gama alta.
El resumen del rendimiento del LG G6 hace que las dudas iniciales se disipen rápidamente ya que todos los componentes responden, incluida la GPU Adreno 530 que es de la partida… Siempre que tomemos como referencia los modelos actuales (como por ejemplo el Huawei P10). ¿Y el futuro? Pues cuando llegue veremos, pero un mejor procesador siempre trae mayor potencia, eso es una realidad incuestionable.
En este apartado la compañía mantiene el tipo no sólo de forma digna, ya que creemos que estamos ante uno de los modelos más destacados del mercado actual en lo que tiene que ver con la fotografía. La cámara trasera consta de dos lentes que tienen angular diferente -pero con resolución de 13 megapíxeles en ambos casos-: 71 grados (F:1,8) y 125 (F:2.4). Esto permite “jugar” incluso simulando en ocasiones un zoom óptico y, evidentemente, la amplitud de las tomas que se consiguen es simplemente sideral. Muy buena solución la utilizada y nos ha gustado mucho.
Los resultados que se obtienen son muy precisos, con mucho detalle y ricos en luminosidad. Muy buen rango dinámico que evita que se quemen las luces intensas, y la representación de los colores es bastante buena (pero, en algún caso descubrimos cierto “pasteleo” inesperado). Si hablamos en tomas oscuras o de noche, evidentemente se pierde calidad, pero no es precisamente un desastre y el detalle sigue siendo convincente… aunque este apartado debido a limitaciones propias de estos dispositivos no es el más estable en los smartphones -y hablamos en general, no en este caso en particular-.
La aplicación de control de la cámara es una de las mejores del mercado, donde hay opciones de todo tipo y se permite un Modo Pro como no puede ser de otra forma y, además, se puede guardar en RAW las fotos que se hacen. Aprender a manejar el desarrollo es muy sencillo, lo que es un gran acierto, y a destacar el Modo Cámara Cuadrada, que permite hacer composiciones tipo collage y, que es llamativo y útil (acabamos utilizándolo de forma muy habitual). Esto es diferente y aprovecha al máximo las opciones de la pantalla del LG G6.
Las grabaciones que hicimos en el análisis del LG G6 fueron de calidad y el estabilizador óptico hace su función de forma más que correcta. Como con las fotos, el procesamiento de los resultados es rápido, y el enfoque también. Se llega a calidad 4K, como no pude ser de otra forma, y el sonido que se adquiere es potente y preciso. Un muy buen trabajo en este apartado.
Indudablemente en el análisis del LG G6 hemos encontrado un terminal de lo mejor que hemos visto, pero que está por ver si aguantará el tipo con los que llegarán antes del verano. Eso sí, la potencia no le falta al teléfono, así como una pantalla de buena calidad y añadidos que nos han gustado mucho, como la protección frente al agua y polvo. Además, el sistema operativo, concretamente la personalización aciertan.
Eso sí, quizá algo más de RAM y almacenamiento interno, que se queda en 32 “gigas” hubieran estado bien para llamar más la atención. E, incluyendo una buena cámara trasera, la propia de los selfies no llega a su nivel, y esto se hace notar. Pero, la verdad, es que el sabor de boca que nos ha dejado este análisis del LG G6 es mucho mejor que el de la generación anterior.
Pantalla de muy buena calidad.
Cámara trasera de gran repuesta.
Protección frente al agua y polvo.
Por cierto, un detalle que debemos comentar: la cámara frontal de 5 megapíxeles (F:2.2) no ofrece la misma calidad que la trasera y, pese a un angular respetable, encontramos resultados con contornos manifiestamente mejorables.

Estos son algunos ejemplos de lo que hemos conseguido con el análisis del LG G6 donde el balance de blancos se muestra bastante eficiente en muchos de los casos:

En lo que tiene que ver con la autonomía, la verdad es que esta es solvente, no la mejor que hemos visto, pero permite que el día de uso se consiga sin especiales problemas. Si se abusa de la pantalla el terminal se resiente aquí, pero los 3.300 mAh de amperaje de la batería no desentonan como en un principio se puede creer al tener claro que la pantalla es de 5,7 pulgadas. Además, se incluye compatibilidad con recarga rápida Quick Charge 3.0, que es efectiva y un buen salvavidas. Se cumple, por lo tanto.

La experiencia de uso es muy buena, juegos incluidos, y el control termal excelente (en recarga hay que decir que, como era de esperar, el calor aumenta). El caso es que nada se le resiste en exceso al LG G6 y responde en cualquier cometido que se le asigne, sea  o no en condiciones de multitarea -y sin el más mínimo lag-. Por cierto, no apreciamos problema alguno de retardo por el nuevo ratio de la pantalla, lo que es positivo.

Estos son los resultados obtenidos en las pruebas de rendimiento que habitualmente manejamos en MovilZona:

A la pantalla no le falta protección Gorilla Glass y, por lo tanto, es muy completa en líneas generales. La verdad es que aquí ha dejado una buena impronta el LG G6 y, sinceramente, este apartado ha evolucionado como merece un modelo de gama alta.

La calidad de las imágenes que se muestran en la pantalla es muy buena, con una definición de los colores muy acertada (con excesivo contraste en ocasiones) y una respuesta excelente. Todo se ve perfectamente y no tuvimos las sensación de un abuso en el consumo. El brillo es bueno, pero nos hubiera gustado algo más de “potencia” para que en exteriores el panel muestre un mejor comportamiento. Pero, en líneas generales, es muy buena la experiencia visual.

Los laterales están muy bien acabados y en la parte derecha está la bandeja para las tarjetas -las microSD llegan hasta los 2 TB- y en el lado izquierdo los botones de volumen (partido) que tienen un tacto excelente y resistencia. En el análisis del LG G6 hemos visto que no se ha perdido el puerto de auriculares (lo que se agradece) y, además, en la parte inferior está el USB tipo C, que es compatible con el estándar 3.1 y es realmente rápido para todo tipo de cometidos -aquí también está el altavoz, que sin ser de mala calidad es cierto que aquí la compañía debe evolucionar frente a algunos de su competencia-.

En lo que tiene que ver con las dimensiones, a destacar que el grosor está por debajo de los ocho milímetros y eso se nota ya que permite una manipulación sencilla. El peso es de 163 gramos que, a nuestro juicio, no está especialmente bien distribuido y en ocasiones da la sensación que es más de lo que realmente hemos indicado. En lo que tiene que ver con la ergonomía, es un claro acierto que los acabados redondeados sean la nota predominante, ya que el uso continuado es cómodo y este es de agradecer.

Lo primero que se tiene que saber es que, al contrario de lo que ocurrió con el LG G5, en este modelo los accesorios integrados no son de la partida. Hay que despedirse de ellos, así se ha decidido en la compañía (veremos si alguna gama de producto los hereda). Eso sí, esto ha supuesto que se incluyan algunas opciones que eran necesarias para compartir en la gama alta actual. Por ejemplo, el no poder abrir el terminal permite que el LG G6 sea compatible con el estándar IP68 y, esto, supone que ofrece resistencia al agua y polvo. Por lo tanto, que se incluya esta opción era algo necesario y esperado… Y, aquí, el fabricante no ha defraudado. Se empieza bien.

"Un año después de la aventura del G5, el smartphone modular que aterrizó en el mercado como una revolución pero que no logró seducir a la mayoría del público, a LG le llega la hora de reinventarse para intentar recuperar todo el terreno perdido durante estos últimos años en los que se ha visto superada, especialmente en Europa, por el empuje de las marcas chinas.
El nuevo tope de gama de LG dice adiós a los módulos para apostar fuerte por un cambio rompedor a nivel de pantalla, que estrena un formato muy enfocado al consumo multimedia de series y películas que seguro veremos en muchos más terminales a lo largo de los próximos meses.
Este nuevo diseño implica un cambio de filosofía enorme respecto al LG G5, que todavía parece más acusado por la decisión de la marca de no comercializar su otro buque insignia -LG V20- dentro de las fronteras europeas.
¿Merece la pena comprar el LG G6 o es recomendable esperar a la llegada de los gama alta de otros fabricantes? Para intentar arrojar algo de luz a lo largo de esta review del LG G6 vamos a desgranar todos los detalles del smartphone, para entender qué supone en la práctica contar con una pantalla de 18:9.
Por supuesto, mediremos el nivel de su cámara de fotos tanto de día como de noche además de examinar su rendimiento, especialmente por la incorporación de un procesador que ya no es el más potente dentro del universo Android.
El LG G6 rompe con alguna que otra tradición muy reconocible en generaciones anteriores. La más evidente es la pérdida de la batería extraíble, una de las características más aplaudidas por los usuarios del LG G5 pero que parece tener los días contados dentro de la gama alta: salvo sorpresa no habrá ningún buque insignia con esta funcionalidad en todo el 2017.
A cambio conseguimos un certificado IP68 que nos garantiza la máxima resistencia frente al polvo y el agua: el LG G6 es sumergible en agua hasta 1,5 metros de profundidad durante un máximo de 30 minutos.
Fabricado en aluminio de la más alta calidad, el G6 es un smartphone unibody que está protegido frente a golpes, pequeñas caídas y arañazos de una forma un tanto peculiar. La parte trasera incorpora una lámina Corning Gorilla Glass 5 -la última generación- que en teoría ofrece un 80% de resistencia frente a caídas de 1,6 metros, un nivel de protección del que solo gozan unos pocos terminales. 
La decisión de apostar por el cristal para ambas caras del móvil tiene sus ventajas, especialmente a nivel estético y de ergonomía, pero también algunos inconvenientes: el principal es que suelen ser un auténtico imán para las huellas, algo que también sucede en este G6, aunque con menos incidencia en el modelo de color blanco que hemos probado para esta review.
Una de las señas de identidad de la gama alta de LG que se mantiene en este G6 es la posición de su botón de encendido y apagado, que también hace las veces de lector de huellas, ubicado en la parte posterior del smartphone.
Curiosamente, salvo sorpresa mayúscula el LG G6 será el único smartphone de gama alta que lleve el lector de huellas a la parte trasera en 2017, lo que quizás se convierta en un inesperado motivo de compra para algunos usuarios.
A pesar de que hace algunos meses muchos se atrevieran a aventurar que la decisión de Apple de eliminar el jack para auriculares en el iPhone 7 marcaría tendencia sobre el resto de fabricantes la realidad ha sido otra bien diferente, síntoma de que todavía es pronto para quitar de cuajo ese conector. En el caso del LG G6 se encuentra en el borde superior del teléfono, en el que también son visibles las bandas de las antenas.
Al otro lado, en el borde inferior, tenemos el puerto de USB Tipo C flanqueado por el altavoz principal y el micrófono para las llamadas. Los bordes laterales, que también gozan de un cuidado diseño, se completan con la bandeja extraíble para introducir una tarjeta nanoSIM y una microSD (flanco derecho) y los controles de volumen (flanco izquierdo).
En la parte trasera manda por supuesto la doble cámara que no sobresale ni un milímetro -otra ventaja respecto al LG G5- de la que hablaremos en profundidad más adelante.
Acabamos el recorrido por el diseño del LG G6 con lo más espectacular. La parte frontal poco tiene que ver con el resto de móviles presentes en el mercado ya que la pantalla gana un peso enorme al relegar los bordes al mínimo de su expresión, especialmente en los laterales.
Un diseño con un extraordinario ratio de pantalla/cuerpo -superior al 78%- que nos permite disfrutar de una pantalla de 5,7 pulgadas en un smartphone en el que habitualmente encontraríamos un panel de 5,2 pulgadas, hasta el punto de que las dimensiones del LG G6 quedan incluso por debajo de las que vimos en el LG G5.
La decisión de apostar por una pantalla con formato 18:9 -en lo que nos detendremos en profundidad en el siguiente apartado- permite a nivel de diseño recortar el ancho del dispositivo.
Turno para uno de los apartados centrales de este análisis del LG G6, que presume de una pantalla con un aspecto muy distinto a todos los demás ya que cuenta con un formato de 18:9 (2:1) en lugar de los convencionales 16:9 que encontramos en la mayoría de smartphones.
Antes de entrar a explicar qué significa este cambio y cómo puede afectar al usuario empezaremos por repasar las características básicas. El LG G6 cuenta con un panel LCD con tecnología IPS, una decisión que no es nueva pero sorprenderá a muchos ya que la marca surcoreana es la principal fabricante de paneles OLED para televisores.
Paradójicamente LG no ha apostado por esta tecnología para sus smartphones, que en los últimos años se ha reservado a la gama LG G Flex y a los smartwatches, incluyendo los últimos lanzados en el pasado MWC de Barcelona. Los costes de fabricación, la supuesta vida útil (más prolongada en los paneles IPS) y la mejor fidelidad a la hora de reproducir el abanico de colores parecen estar detrás de la decisión de LG por apostar la tecnología IPS.
La reproducción de colores también ha mejorado significativamente respecto al LG G5, especialmente en los tonos blancos, aunque es verdad que no llega al nivel de espectacularidad de los paneles OLED si lo utilizamos de manera convencional.
Hasta aquí la teoría, ahora queda explicar qué sucede en la práctica con la pantalla FullVision del LG G6. Para empezar contamos con una resolución poco convencional (2.880 x 1440 píxeles) que no funciona de manera nativa en la mayoría de aplicaciones y videojuegos.
La cuestión es si a medio y largo plazo podremos disfrutar de más contenidos nativos -sobre todo en el terreno multimedia: series, películas y videojuegos- en formato 18:9.
¿Qué formato es mejor para reproducir películas? A pesar de que el formato 16:9 está muy extendido tanto en televisores como en dispositivos móviles -fundamentalmente en smartphones- lo cierto es que la apuesta de LG se traslada en una experiencia más completa.
Además, como se puede ver en la siguiente imagen, el panel del nuevo smartphone de LG se adapta mucho mejor al formato 2:35:1, utilizado también en muchas de las producciones audiovisuales más recientes, dejando unas barras negras mucho menos gruesas en el borde superior y en el inferior que si lo hacemos con un panel tradicional de 16:9.
Netlfix y Amazon Prime Video van a ser pioneros en este campo, permitiendo al usuario reproducir algunas (de momento pocas) de sus producciones con el formato original de 18:9 y, además, utilizando la tecnología HDR para completar una experiencia sobresaliente.
Nuestra experiencia a la hora de reproducir vídeos en formato 18:9 durante este análisis del LG G6 no ha podido ser mejor. Sin embargo a la hora de reproducir contenidos en 16:9 tendremos que elegir entre quedarnos con unas barras negras a los lados u optar por el reescalado que como decíamos antes puede traducirse en que nos perdamos parte de la información importante en pantalla.
Por supuesto, contamos con un modo de pantalla always-on que nos permite consultar las notificaciones del teléfono sin necesidad de encender la pantalla. LG ha añadido una nueva opción que eleva ligeramente el brillo de este modo para que sea útil incluso manejando el teléfono en exteriores. 
Una pantalla de altísima calidad en el plano técnico, con un contraste increíble que poco tiene que envidiar a los paneles OLED, con tecnología HDR, sin apenas marcos, una relación de aspecto 18:9 que es una delicia a la hora de consumir contenidos multimedia y bordes redondeados.
El nuevo buque insignia llega por supuesto de la mano de Android Nougat, lo que de primeras ya es una buena noticia. En la unidad que hemos recibido para escribir esta review nos hemos encontrado con la versión 7.0, aunque es de esperar que en las próximas semanas con motivo del lanzamiento oficial el smartphone se actualice a la 7.1.2 con todo lo bueno que ello conlleva.
La filosofía se intuye en la propia pantalla de desbloqueo, formada por dos cuadrados (1:1) idénticos, que será la forma de visualizar varias de las aplicaciones ""básicas del teléfono"". Así lo experimentamos por ejemplo en el reproductor de música o en el calendario, que con esta nueva fórmula es muchísimo más práctico ya que con la pantalla apaisada podemos ver fácilmente las citas y reuniones de cada día.
De serie no contamos con un cajón de aplicaciones sino que la interfaz se gestional estilo de los iPhone. De todas maneras esto se puede cambiar fácilmente a través de la primera actualización que recibe el smartphone nada más iniciarse, lo que permite al usuario elegir entre un modelo de menús u otro. Además podemos modificar la posición de los botones virtuales en pantalla, teniendo la opción de incluir hasta cinco.
La fortaleza a nivel de software del LG G6 sin embargo sale a relucir con la pantalla partida que nos permite abrir dos aplicaciones al mismo tiempo. Tenemos la opción de hacer más grande una pantalla que otra o de que ocupen el 50% de la pantalla, lo que viene a ser especialmente útil si por ejemplo nos interesa tener la aplicación de notas abierta al mismo tiempo que reproducimos un víde de YouTube.
En principio solo podemos abrir algunas aplicaciones en pantalla partida, pero tenemos algunos trucos a mano. Por ejemplo podemos abrir dos páginas web con Google Chrome si al seleccionar el modo de pantalla partida con Chrome pulsamos en la opción de abrir un enlace en una ventana nueva.
Una de las ventajas de la pantalla 18:9 del LG G6 más evidentes es que podemos disfrutar de más contenidos en un simple vistazo. Esto se traduce en que podemos ver mejor las notificaciones recibidas o, por ejemplo, tenemos más líneas visibles en pantalla sobre un mismo site o artículo periodístico, lo que incide positivamente sobre la lectura.
El nuevo LG G6 esconde en su interior un chip Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 que a día de hoy parece el más avanzado dentro del universo Android pero que será desbancado por su hermano mayor -Snapdragon 835- en cuestión de semanas, ¿cuál es la razón?
LG entiende que esperar más de tres meses entre la presentación del teléfono y su puesta a la venta sería perder una ventana de oportunidad sensacional para adelantarse a los competidores. Y no hay dudas sobre el rendimiento ya que el smartphone incorpora un chip que sigue ofreciendo una experiencia extremadamente fluida incluso para los usuarios más exigentes.
Nuestra experiencia a lo largo de este análisis del LG G6 ha sido sobresaliente, incluso a la hora de gestionar la multitarea o al mover dos apps a la vez con el interesantísimo modo de pantalla partida. Para ello cuenta con 4 GB de memoria RAM LPDDR4 que ofrecen más a un coste de autonomía menor que lo que vimos en el LG G5.
Claro que siendo justos estamos ante unas especificaciones que probablemente se vean bastante superadas por la competencia en los próximos meses. Una de las cosas difíciles de entender es que el nuevo smartphone de LG cuenta con una capacidad de almacenamiento de 32 GB que, si bien pueden ampliarse fácilmente vía microSD, quedan por debajo de la media de otros gama alta.
Pese a que contamos con soporte para Vulkan, lo que nos garantiza una buena experiencia con los juegos más avanzados del mercado, y que el teléfono está más que capacitado para experiencias de realidad virtual el nuevo LG G6 no es compatible con la tecnología DayDream de Google que promete llevar ese universo hasta nuevos límites en los próximos meses.
Las mejoras del LG G6 han llegado por supuesto también al apartado fotográfico. La primera buena noticia es que el fabricante surcoreano dice adiós al sinsentido de la guerra de los megapíxeles que hemos visto en los últimos años: mayor resolución no tiene obligatoriamente que traducirse en una calidad mayor de imagen, ya que entran en juego muchísimos factores.
La filosofía es muy parecida a la del año pasado. Volvemos a hablar de doble cámara trasera -una característica que comienza a parecer ""obligatoria"" dentro de la gama alta-, una de ellas con lente gran angular, pero en este caso ambos sensores cuentan con 13 megapíxeles, de ahí que ahora resulte mucho más complicado hablar de cámara principal y secundaria.
En el plano más técnico la cámara ""normal"" sigue siendo la principal ya que es la más capaz de las dos al contar con una mayor apertura (f/1.8) que permite capturar más luz, estabilizador óptico de imagen (OIS) y tecnología de autoenfoque por detección de fase (PDAF), en lugar del sistema de autoenfoque láser del LG G5.
También cambia la relación de aspecto. Si en el G5 ambas cámaras funcionaban de manera nativa en formato 16:9 ahora por defecto realizaremos fotografías en 4:3. De hecho, si queremos forzar a la cámara a realizar fotografías en 16:9 nos deberemos ""conformar"" con una resolución bastante menor, de 9.7 megapíxeles para ser exactos.
Por lo general con el LG G6 conseguiremos fotografías con un nivel de detalle extraordinario, unos colores vibrantes, un contraste sobresaliente y normalmente con un amplio rango dinámico. Esto habla muy bien del equipo de ingenieros surcoreano ya que las diferencias respecto a móviles de otras marcas que montan el mismo sensor de Sony son gigantescas.
Las mejoras respecto al LG G5 también son evidentes. El nuevo smartphone es capaz de conseguir fotografías con un nivel mucho más elevado de detalle y, además, acostumbra a representar mejor tanto los colores como las luces de cualquier escena.
Siguiendo la filosofía del año pasado el nuevo LG G6 cuenta con un gran angular de 121 grados que nos permite capturar mucha más información de todo lo que tenemos a nuestro alrededor, lo que se traduce en perspectivas a menudo imposibles de replicar con otros smartphones. 
La cámara frontal de 5 megapíxeles ofrece unos resultados por lo general notables, contando como ventaja principal la posibilidad de hacerse selfies con una apertura gran angular en la que cabe casi todo el mundo. Aquí -eso sí- los problemas son evidentes en condiciones de poca luz.
En el plano más práctico a lo largo de esta review del LG G6 nos hemos enamorado de la función carrusel que activa una tira de imágenes en un extremo de la pantalla a modo de vista previa, lo que ahorra muchísimo tiempo al no tener que abrir una y otra vez la galería de fotos, sacando provecho del aumento de píxeles con la nueva relación de aspecto 18:9 de la pantalla.
A los que utilizan Instagram a todas horas les encantará el nuevo modo de cámara cuadrada (formato 1:1) que encaja perfectamente con las imágenes de esta red social. Pero este modo va mucho más allá. Al dividir la pantalla en dos cuadrados podremos acceder a los siguientes modos:
En definitiva la cámara del LG G6 es una de las más completas y divertidas que hemos probado jamás. Puede que no llegue al nivel de excelencia de otros competidores, que ofrecen mayor nivel de detalle y resultados todavía más espectaculares tanto en las fotografías nocturnas como en los selfies realizados con la cámara frontal, con modos también interesantes como el de retrato del iPhone 7 Plus.
La batería del LG G6 ha aumentado significativamente respecto a la generación anterior para llegar a los 3.300 miliamperios, algo que no sorprende ya que contamos con una pantalla ligeramente más grande y -sobre todo- porque no contamos con la funcionalidad que aporta una batería extraíble.
Durante nuestras pruebas con la unidad que hemos recibido para el análisis del LG G6 hemos conseguido llegar al final del día con un uso bastante intensivo en el que hemos conjugado varias horas de pantalla encendida (alrededor de cinco), abriendo varios juegos, sincronizando varias cuentas de correo y reproduciendo múltiples vídeos vía YouTube y Netflix.
En el apartado de conectividad encontramos algunas luces y sombras. Para empezar el smartphone cuenta es LTE Cat 12, lo que significa que tiene capacidad para descargar datos por redes móviles al doble de velocidad (hasta 600 Mbps) que la generación anterior, algo que en la práctica no vamos a experimentar porque la infraestructura no está preparada para ello, pero que se queda lejos de lo que serán capaces de ofrecer los smartphones con el Snapdragon 835, preparado para llegar a los 1024 Mbps.
En el apartado de sonido nos encontramos con algún que otro interrogante. LG apostó fuerte el año pasado en este sentido, colaborando activamente con una de las marcas más reconocidas del sector (Bang&Olufsen) tanto en el LG G5 como en el LG V20, que no ha llegado a España y se mantiene por delante del nuevo G6 en este apartado.
Llegamos al final de este análisis del LG G6 con sensaciones bastante positivas. El fabricante surcoreano ha dejado atrás la idea de los módulos que no terminó de cuajar entre el gran público para apostar por una pantalla que no solo es enorme a nivel de tamaño sino que incorpora la última tecnología para disfrutar de una experiencia multimedia sensacional.
La cámara es otro de los elementos que juegan a favor del LG G6. Como decíamos antes puede que no sea la más avanzada del mercado pero sí es una de las más versátiles y divertidas, fundamentalmente por la apuesta del gran angular que ahora sí está a un nivel aceptable y el esfuerzo a nivel de software por ofrecer modos para hacer fotografías originales de una forma muy sencilla.
El precio oficial del LG G6 en España será de 749 euros, un importe considerable que todo apunta se quedará ligeramente por debajo del nuevo smartphone de Samsung. ¿Merece la pena comprarlo? Esa es la pregunta del millón. Estamos ante un smartphone recomendable, con importantes mejoras en apartados tangenciales -diseño, pantalla y cámara- que ya está disponible en el mercado a un precio muy competitivo.
Muchos esperarán a ver cómo se desenvuelve parte de la competencia, especialmente el Sony Xperia XZ Premium y -sobre todo- el Samsung Galaxy S8. Para comprar estos dos últimos habrá que esperar todavía unas cuantas semanas, así que hoy por hoy es más que evidente que el LG G6 está a la altura de los mejores móviles del mercado.

Claro que para sacarle todo el partido necesitamos contar con contenidos que saquen el máximo partido a todo esto. A día de hoy todavía son pocos y a pesar de que Netflix y Amazon Prime Video ofrecerán compatibilidad dentro de muy poco la verdad es que en el día a día no siempre estaremos sacando partido de todo lo que es capaz este G6.

Y es que la ausencia del Quad DAC en el modelo europeo puede desanimar a los más audiófilos. Aún así sigue estando por delante de la competencia ya que ofrece la posibilidad de reproducir audio en formato de 32 bits y además ofrece soporte para el códec aptX-HD de Qualcomm que permite la transmisión de música vía Bluetooth prácticamente sin pérdida, algo que por ahora solo hemos visto en el LG G6 y el LG G5

Además nos dejamos por el camino el puerto infrarrojos -presente en el LG G5- y en la versión que se venderá en España tampoco contaremos con la funcionalidad de carga inalámbrica que sí estará presente en la versión a la venta en Estados Unidos. Lo que sí tenemos es radio FM (con los auriculares como antena) que ha desaparecido casi del resto de buques insignia.

Son números notables que permitirán a algunos irse a dormir sin necesidad de enchufar el teléfono, pero desafortunadamente no se colocan a la cabeza del ránking de teléfonos con mayor autonomía. La gestión de la batería se puede mejorar a través de los diversos modos de ahorro que incorpora la capa de software y, sobre todo, si echamos mano de la tecnología de carga rápida (Quick Charge 3.0) con la que hemos conseguido recuperar el 40% de la batería en 30 minutos y alrededor del 70% en una hora. 

En la práctica, sin embargo, la cámara del LG G6 goza de una enorme versatilidad y permite al usuario jugar con muchísimas fórmulas para conseguir imágenes irrepetibles.

Otra parte fundamental de las mejoras del G6 a nivel de cámara tienen que ver con el software. LG se ha esforzado en que podamos sacarle partido tanto a sus sensores como a su espectacular pantalla. Tenemos por un lado controles manuales muy avanzados tanto a la hora de hacer fotos como si queremos grabar vídeos, pudiendo incluso calibrar los micrófonos (filtro de aire incluido) para conseguir un sonido de altísima calidad que se sitúa por encima de la competencia, una característica heredada del LG V20.

El buen trabajo en cuanto al procesamiento de la imagen sale a relucir en las fotografías nocturnas, donde el sensor principal del LG G6 se defiende estupendamente incluso con el modo automático, sin que detectemos apenas ruido, ni siquiera al realizar zoom sobre la imagen como se puede ver a continuación.

Probablemente a más de uno le preocupe leer que el LG G6 trabaja con un un sensor Sony IMX228 por lo general orientados a la gama media: por ejemplo los vemos en el Sony Xperia XA o en el OnePlus X. Sin embargo a la hora de hablar de una cámara de fotos entran muchas más cosas en juego, siendo elemental el procesamiento de la imagen.



Por otro lado el nuevo buque insignia renuncia curiosamente al sensor de espectro de color que veíamos en anteriores generaciones, algo que en la práctica pasa por alto por la buena calibración que es capaz de conseguir cualquiera de las dos cámaras traseras.



De hecho a nivel de hardware la configuración del LG G6 es similar a la del Google Pixel XL -no disponible todavía en España- o la del OnePlus 3T -sin presencia oficial en nuestro país-, dos teléfonos que hoy por hoy siguen estando a la cabeza de lo que entendemos como ""gama alta"".

Ese nuevo chip, que llega fundamentalmente de la mano de mejoras a nivel de conectividad, procesador y tarjeta gráfica, se presentó a principios de año pero ha tardado más de lo previsto en llegar a las cadenas de producción: el nuevo Xperia XZ Premium de Sony no se podrá a la venta -como mínimo- hasta el mes de mayo.

Además de todas las ventajas de Nougat contamos todavía con algunas aportaciones más de la marca surcoreana. Algunas enfocadas a la seguridad: podemos bloquear la galería de fotos y nuestras notas QuickMemo+ con la huella dactilar para evitar miradas indiscretas. También tenemos la posibilidad de ajustar las Smart Settings para -por ejemplo- activar el WiFi cuando entramos en casa o la opción de reinstalar apps desinstaladas en las últimas 24 horas sin necesidad de volverlas a descargar.

Además del mencionado método de reescalado de la pantalla contamos con una última característica importante. El LG G6 viene de serie con el nuevo asistente de Google, aunque éste desafortunadamente por ahora solo está disponible en inglés.



Además, a través de las opciones de desarrollador puedes activar esta función con todas las apps. Eso sí, aquí LG ya no puede garantizar una experiencia perfecta.



En el plano más estético encontramos también algunas novedades interesantes. Para empezar contamos con un puñado de fondos de pantalla muy cuidados que son fruto de una colaboración entre LG y la casa Pantone. Podemos además elegir entre varios temas, aplicar diferentes estilos a los iconos -con o sin fondo-, llevar hasta cinco accesos directos a la barra inferior o modificar el tamaño de dichos iconos para visualizar más o menos en pantalla.

Los esfuerzos de LG a nivel de software en este G6 se han centrado en maximizar los beneficios de la pantalla 18:9. Y la verdad es que se nota en muchísimos detalles que nos dejan aprovechar mejor esta relación de aspecto, lo que se traduce en una experiencia de usuario mucho más intuitiva, positiva y, en definitiva, una productividad mucho mayor.

En definitiva la pantalla del LG G6 es una ventana al futuro de lo que está por venir en el universo de los smartphones. Hasta hace nada los fabricantes parecían enfrascados en una carrera para aumentar el tamaño del teléfono para tener unas pantallas más grandes; LG demuestra que no es necesario, bastaba con eliminar los bordes.

El nuevo formato 18:9 del LG G6 tiene otras ventajas. Una de las más evidentes es que, al ser una pantalla más alargada, podemos visualizar más información tanto a la hora de navegar como al abrir ciertas apps y redes sociales como Twitter o Facebook, lo que sin duda es una enorme ventaja.

Lo que probablemente llame la atención de muchos es que los bordes del panel del LG G6 no son cuadrados sino más o menos redondeados, y decimos ""más o menos"" ya que no se trata de una curva perfecta sino achaflanada con el objetivo de reducir los posibles problemas ante caídas al suelo.



El problema es muy simple. A pesar de que se suele rodar en estos formatos en la práctica resulta muy complicado encontrarlos con este ratio de aspecto para el consumidor, ya que casi todos los servicios y aplicaciones ofrecen contenidos reescalados a 16:9 para su visualización correcta en la myoría de dispositivos.

En los últimos años se han grabado contenidos en formato Univisium 2:1 -Stranger Things o House of Cards son dos buenos ejemplos- que se adaptarían perfectamente a la pantalla del G6. 

A pesar de que el formato 16:9 parece más que establecido actualmente en el mundo audiovisual varios indicios nos señalan que LG parece haber tomado la decisión adecuada: varias series originales de Netlfix ya se ruedan en formato 2:1 (idéntico al 18:9).

Por otro lado, la tendencia en diseño web va enfocada a sites más alargados que se ajustan mejor a la visualización en vertical con el LG G6.

Para solucionarlo LG permite el reescalado de las aplicaciones de una manera muy sencilla, pudiendo elegir cómo queremos visualizarla: si elegimos el formato de pantalla completa (18:9) corremos el riesgo de que desapareca parte de la imagen original.

Sin embargo, una de las mayores virtudes del LG G6 es la incorporación de la tecnología HDR y el sello de DolbyVision, lo que nos permite disfrutar de contenidos con una tecnología equiparable a la de los mejores televisores presentes en el mercado.

Según nuestras pruebas la pantalla del LG G6 es sencillamente espectacular en todos los apartados. Su nivel de luminosidad es muy superior a la anterior generación, asegurando una correcta visualización incluso en exteriores bajo la luz directa del sol, pero sobre todo destaca por su fantástico contraste que deja muy lejos a casi toda la competencia.

En los últimos tiempos incluso se ha convertido en proveedor de Apple, suministrando paneles OLED para la última generación de Apple Watch y según apuntan muchos rumores, para el futuro iPhone 8, lo que se traduciría en una importante fuente de ingresos para la compañía.

El LG G6 es el más estrecho de toda la gama alta, lo que se traduce en una mejor ergonomía siendo mucho más manejable con una sola mano, lo que es una enorme ventaja para disfrutar de un smartphone de 5,7 pulgadas, difuminando por completo el concepto de phablet que muchos asociaban a un teléfono de grandes dimensiones.



Los sensores están separados por el flash LED dual, colocado justo encima del mencionado botón que hace las veces de lector de huellas. El resto de la trasera queda bastante limpio, con solo un pequeño logotipo del G6 en la parte inferior. 



Para mí supone una ventaja, ya que resulta más cómodo al sostenerlo en la mano, pero es una mera cuestión de gustos ya que otros alegarán que no se puede utilizar si lo tenemos puesto sobre una superficie plana.

En cambio toda la parte frontal y el cristal de la doble cámara trasera están protegidos por una lámina de cristal Corning Gorilla Glass 3, lanzada al mercado en 2013, que en principio es un poco más gruesa y algo menos resistente que la que encontramos en el otro lado del teléfono, ¿cuestión de costes?

No es recomendable meterse con él en la piscina pero al menos nos aseguramos que sobrevivirá a despistes o pequeños accidentes. Algo de lo que por cierto no puede presumir la mayoría de sus rivales.



Con todo, el fabricante surcoreano aspira a batir las cifras de la pasada temporada con este nuevo LG G6 y así recortar distancias a nivel global respecto a Huawei, Oppo o Vivo y superar en el plano más local a marcas como Alcatel o ZTE.

Todo esto con importantes mejoras en el resto de apartados, por supuesto a nivel de rendimiento pero también en relación al apartado fotográfico o el software como explicaremos más adelante.

A pesar de que Nokia acaparó casi todos los titulares del pasado Mobile World Congress de Barcelona la innovación llegó de la mano de la marca surcoreana, que presentó un smartphone que marcará tendencia a corto y medio plazo como vamos a explicar detalladamente en este análisis del LG G6, uno de los principales buques insignia de 2017.

"The G6 is a great phone from LG, one that pushes the brand back to the forefront of the smartphone pile in terms of design and screen. However, lower-spec performance and not upgrading the camera in a meaningful way while still charging a huge premium make this a tough sell.
With the LG G6, the modular design of the LG G5 is gone in favor of a more traditional phone, one that takes multiple elements from the top handsets around, blended together to make a more prosaic (but still intriguing) handset.  The G6 is a much more conservative design than its predecessor, taking the form of a sealed unit that drops the removable battery, replacing it with a larger-capacity power pack and waterproof shell.  Surprisingly, this phone isn't using the latest chipset from Qualcomm, so you won't be getting the full grunt of the Snapdragon 835. However, LG maintains this was a decision to benefit the consumer – using a chip it had expertise with rather than an unknown entity it couldn't test fully.  Instead, it's going with a Snapdragon 821 option, which LG told us was a better option given it had more experience working with the chip and could thus extract more performance rather than using an untested engine.
The screen is, really, the only place where innovation is still present on the G6, with the longer 18:9 display giving more screen real estate to play with, and introducing some clever little changes to the user interface to exploit the extra pixels.  Beyond that, there's not a lot that marks out the LG G6 from the rest of the competition – and that's a pretty good thing.    Having used the LG G6 for a couple of weeks, it's easy to see that this is a 'grown-up' handset from the South Korean brand. It just feels nicer in the hand, more solid and refined, and we really haven't missed anything from the LG G5 at all.  Early prices were as high as $650/£649/AU$1000, but they're already starting to drop, and while it's still an expensive handset LG seems to have baked all the components together well, so at least you'll be getting a decent phone for the money.  It’s interesting that some reviews have called the LG G6 a 'return to form' - apart from perhaps the LG G2, the brand hasn’t had a stellar flagship device for years. Rather, it feels more like a ‘finally understanding what users actually want in a phone’.
OK - here's the curious thing about this phone. It's got a lower-spec in some areas, has prioritised things like design over an improved camera... and yet still costs far more money than we'd expect.  The LG G6 has an eye-watering £649 SIM free RRP in the UK, which is astronomical given we're used to seeing phones from this brand come in at almost half that cost after a few months of being on sale.  In fact, that might happen again, as many retailers have already dropped the price to a still-steep £580.  In terms of contract pricing, we're looking at around £38 per month minimum if you don't want to spend too much on the phone upfront, which again is rather high.  In the US, contract pricing is set at around $28 per month, which is in the region of Apple's iPhone 7 and the Google Pixel... both of which aren't considered cheap phones.  If you want to go for it SIM free in the North America, you're looking around $550 (down from a launch price of roughly $650), where it's AU$1,000 for those over in Australia.  For a limited time, you can trade in your old phone at Verizon to get the G6 for 50% off, which is a pretty tempting deal.  The LG G6 release date has already been and gone for most territories, with the UK one of the last to get its hands on the device - we're hoping that as it becomes more widespread, the cost of ownership continues to come down. 
The LG G6 is covered in a mix of glass and metal, with two sheets of Gorilla Glass (although weirdly it's Gorilla Glass 5 on the rear, but only the much older Gorilla Glass 3 on the front) framed with a rim of aluminum.
What's most impressive is how little bezel there is on this phone – we've now seen the same kind of design from Samsung on the Galaxy S8, but the narrow bezels have been shrunken top and bottom to create an impressive effect when you turn the phone on.
Anyone aware of the LG G5's design will be surprised by just how… normal this phone looks. Gone is the dull plastic back of the LG G3, the odd leather of the G4 or the come-apart design of last year’s phone – the LG G6 is smooth and classy all the way around.  That will disappoint those who like the way LG has taken things in a different direction in the past, but honestly, the G6 design is a smart move. It’s the most classically understated and sophisticated phone we’ve ever seen from LG, and it’s the perfect platform for letting the internals shine through.  And it's got the features that matter, like IP68 certification for water and dust resistance - a common flagship feature that was missing from the LG G5.  The rear of the phone is smooth, with no protruding camera bump – we’ll get onto the snapper in a moment, but LG told us it chose slimmer sensors rather than more advanced camera tech to make the design of the phone sleeker.  It's a gamble, but last year's camera was fine, and LG can probably just get away without another change.
There are two sensors on the rear of the phone, above the round fingerprint sensor, which also doubles as a power button.    The LG G6 is currently available in platinum, black and white, although it was strongly hinted to us that more colors will be popping up soon.  The platinum is the most alluring of the colors, with a metallic sheen under the glass that catches the light nicely. However, the white option, with two cameras and round fingerprint sensor below, makes the G6 look a bit like a surprised ghost.
At the bottom of the phone is the single speaker next to the USB-C connector – and LG has kept the headphone jack at the top, declining to bow to the industry trend of dropping the connector as it keeps more 'traditional' (read: everyone) music fans happy.  Some LG phone lovers will be distraught, however, to find that the battery is now sealed into the handset – LG has finally given up on the removable power pack in order to put in a more powerful and slimmer juice unit.  It’s been increased to 3,300mAh within the slimmer 7.9mm frame – and it’s the right move. The need for removable power packs is almost dead thanks to the proliferation of portable battery chargers, but its V-series phones (such as the LG V20 launched last year) keeps the option for now.
MicroSD support still exists, with the up-to-2TB expansion option thrust into the SIM tray, and complementing the 32GB of onboard storage; however, it's really annoying that you can't adopt the storage from the memory card and use it as internal memory like other phones allow you to do.  The design of the LG G6 is certainly more refined - it does feel a bit light and over time the glass back feels more like plastic. That creates slightly sweaty digits, and there have been times when the fingerprint sensor has needed a wipe to function correctly.  However, that sensor is in the right place - rarely was there a misplaced finger when trying to unlock the handset, and the ring on the outside was easy to hit.
The 18:9 screen, (which is branded ‘FullVision’) is created by LG’s own screen division, LG Display. It extends the QHD resolution of its predecessor, making it ever more widescreen to boost the pixel count to 2880 x 1440 and uses LCD technology rather than OLED.  The corners are even curved to keep the aesthetic of the handset, rather than the sharp design most phones pack. It's an interesting move, but doesn't really add much more than novelty.
The lack of OLED is key as it means the LG G6 is not Daydream compatible, so Google's new VR headset won't work with the phone, which is a real shame.  There's not even a new VR offering from LG (although 2016's 360 VR headset was hardly a strong candidate for virtual reality experience of the year) so you'll be limited to Cardboard headsets if you're desperate to enter a virtual world.  While it lacks the colorful pop of the Samsung Galaxy S7, for instance, with its Super AMOLED screen, there's a vivacity that's well complemented by the longer display.  
What is impressive is the addition of Dolby Vision / HDR 10 support for all manner of HDR content.   LG told TechRadar that it's been working with Netflix and Amazon to bring that content to the mobile app.  This means you'll get extra color and detail to your movies that are encoded in this format, bringing a superb experience to the mobile. However, we could only test this by watching the pre-installed Dolby Vision demonstration, which is always going to be impressive.  It's also worth noting that you'll need to be on the top-tier Netflix plan to access this quality - which is thoroughly not worth it if you're just going to be watching on a phone.  The screen on the LG G6 is impressive, but as suspected the larger dimensions are, largely, not much use in apps. What's surprising is some games work better in the larger format - when you open some titles you're presented with a little logo in the top right-hand side of the screen that lets you extend the contents a little further, and gaming seems to deal with this flawlessly.
Most other titles, those which aren't the inbuilt native apps, will just give you a white bar at the bottom where the home and back buttons pop up - it's not that useful, and, as suspected, video doesn't really stretch out that well.  The Always On Display is still a good move - it's something that's both useful and visually appealing on this phone. However, when you're in the dark it's clear to see that the LED lights at the bottom of the screen are illuminating it, with a slight flare protruding up the display.  Of course, it's not a massive problem, but at the same time it doesn't make the G6 look terribly premium.
It's still a curious decision by LG to use LCD over OLED for a number of reasons. Firstly, the contrast ratio (while good) is still not as deep as on Samsung's devices, with the blacks not as true as they could be (and using LCD rules out Daydream support, as previously mentioned).  LG is still using the pervasive display on the lock screen (known as the Always On Display on Samsung phones), so you can see the time without needing to turn on the phone.  Both South Korean brands claim the same battery life reduction for using this feature, but surely it would be more efficient on an OLED panel.
The reason this is so curious is because LG is such a big advocate of OLED panels, and the quality they bring, in the TV space, so believing in LCD technology here still is odd.  And then we get into the awkward mention of the Samsung Galaxy S8 - that's a phone which is all screen and doesn't cost that much more... and in our view, is a far more stunning device when all things are considered.  Not to say that LG hasn't pulled off a nice-looking device with an attractive screen... but it's unfair that Samsung has moved the goalposts so considerably when LG looked like it was just catching up.
The new FullVision 18:9 display has given LG a few more pixels to work with, and now the display is essentially two squares stacked on top of one another. LG has embraced this idea and made the 'double square' a feature of the user interface throughout.  This means, for example, that in the contacts menu the contact image is larger, more settings are visible and you'll be able to see more Facebook on the screen without the need for scrolling through.
You can also rotate the phone and either have two apps running in multi-window or, for certain apps, have two different functions on the screen at once.  This latter trick is currently limited to the email and calendar though, and isn't really that new – plenty of phones have been able to do this for years, but just with a more squished preview window to see your messages and upcoming meetings.
LG's certainly made good use of the extra screen space it's managed to eke out - things like the weather app have been well thought through and look visually appealing.   The general interface doesn't seem like that much of an upgrade, but that's not a bad thing at all. It's all lightning quick under the finger, as you'd expect, and all the elements that Android 7 brings are present and correct.  One flaw that will hopefully be ironed out soon is Google Assistant - while it works pretty well, it's incredibly slow to wake from sleep if you're saying the words 'OK Google' to get it up.  The 'two square' interface isn't as useful as expected, as it's only in the square camera that you'll really notice it. The multi-window mode is still too fiddly on a phone to be a real must-have feature - although we used it from time to time, it wasn't noticeably better than on any previous LG or Samsung phones.
The icons on the home screen (which still comes without an app drawer by default) are tidied up too, with the rounded look applied throughout.   The ability to extend the screen out is nice, but the full-screen extension isn't as easy as on the Galaxy S8 - you need to pull down the notifications shade and it'll pop up... sometimes.  Ultimately, the longer screen hasn't really been used in a way that makes a massive difference here, but everything does feel a bit more immersive.  What LG has done, though, is to create a more refined and mature-looking interface compared to phones gone by - the apps drawer, icons and overall look of everything from the notifications shade to the menus just feel more premium.  It's what LG needed to do: ditching the cartoonish way things were put together and just making things looks decent in the places they're supposed to be.
The LG G6 camera is upgraded in a way, but also remains very similar to last year's in others. The same normal and wide-angle camera lenses are back, but they're now both 13MP.   However, the aperture hasn't improved, nor the pixel size; in short, you're not going to get better snaps day to day with the new G6 phone.  The reason for making them the same resolution is apparently to stop the judder when zooming in – when jumping from wide angle to the closer sensor there was previously a judder that saw the image quality change, and LG says it worked with Qualcomm to bring features from the Snapdragon 835 to the new phone and help fix this.
However, it's not worked, as the judder is still there and there's a tangible difference between the two sensor qualities. It's not a big deal though, as most of the time you'll just tap the icons at the top to choose between the two focal lengths.  The main image sensor packs optical image stabilization, and appears to have a warmer image quality about it, with a faster f/1.8 aperture. The other wide-angle sensor is f/2.4 and lacks the same stabilizer, so images can come out less sharp.  
Overall image quality was clear enough, without being mind-blowing. It doesn't quite stack up to the quality of the iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S8 in most situations, but if you catch the light right and get things in the right conditions it can look really great.  That's the case with many smartphone cameras though, and you'd have to say that LG didn't have a strong enough sensor from last year to not really add in any upgrades.
The new 18:9 screen size has given LG a chance to have two Instagram-friendly squares on the screen at once, and it's used them pretty well.   Our favorite is the large preview, where you can take pictures on one side and have the full-screen previews alongside, which you can scroll through while still snapping.
Alternatively, there's an option to use the same size camera viewfinder as found on the G5, with the extra pixels used to show a strip of recently-taken photos, which again makes it easy to multitask using the camera.  The LG G6 is an advanced phone with a strong camera, even if it's not the best out – there are plenty of new features to enjoy, although they're rather hard to find (the square mode picture options are hidden under myriad menus, or a separate app on another home screen).   LG will struggle to overcome the negative press of not really improving the camera from last year, but with new square features and decent performance, users probably won't mind too much.  As you'll see with some of the samples, you can take some sharp and attractive photos, but in night mode things are very slow and a little blurry around the edges - the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Google Pixel are better options for sure.  
We're also not taken with the dual lenses - it seems that the closer lens is too close, and the wider option gets too much into the frame.
The improvement of the battery from 2,800mAh to 3,300mAh should bring cheers from anyone who wants a phone with a long battery life – LG has historically been excellent at optimizing battery, so packing in more power is always going to be a welcome move.
Whether this is just an excuse remains to be seen – there are many efficiency advantages being touted by Qualcomm in its latest 835 chip – and LG could be just trying to deflect from the decision to use an older (and presumably cheaper) engine in its phone.
(Also, South Korea is getting a Quad DAC amplifier inside, where the rest of the world is not – LG says it's trying to localize the phone more efficiently, but it seems like a lot of hassle).
The LG G6 is a phone that takes things back to basics, and does so well. The sleek metal and glass fusion is attractive, and to anyone using the iPhone 7 Plus, the ratio of screen to body will be staggering.  However, Samsung has now appeared with the Galaxy S8, and that's a phone that cranks the 'bezel-less' phone wars up a notch.
Similarly, the Netflix and Amazon HDR content sound amazing, but it's too early for those to be must-have features, and you'll need to be on high-end plans to make them work properly in the case of Netflix.
There's good reason to be hopeful though, as LG has traditionally lowered its prices quite quickly after launch, and that's already starting to happen in some regions, so even if this handset appears with an eye-watering price it should drop in most territories (although probably not the US, where the G5 has remained rather expensive).
The LG G6 is a phone for those that like the look of the Samsung Galaxy S8 with its bezel-less (ish) screen, and don't want to pay quite as much. That's a niche audience, but we suspect LG isn't too bothered about riding Samsung's coat-tails here.
This is a tricky question to answer, as the real problem we have with this phone is just how blooming expensive it is at launch. We can't see how LG is justifying this price when it's been on such a mission to reduce costs.

However, if you're an LG fan and like what's on offer here, you'll appreciate the longer interface and want to play with the dual-window camera. This is a good camera for social cuts, and if you put the work in you can take some fun snaps.

You'll also like the premium feel of the body, with the metal and glass working nicely together.

Is the LG G6 going to be a strong contender to the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 8? In all honesty, probably not. 

But this is a phone that gives LG a platform to work from, showing it can make a handsome phone with good features; in short, if this is the direction LG is now taking with phone design, you should be already looking forward to the G7.

The LG G6 isn’t the only flagship worth your attention, or even the only all-screen one. Here are three alternatives that you might feel are more worth your money.
There's nothing wrong with this phone, and you'll enjoy the ergonomic way it's put together and the sheer amount of screen on offer.

The camera and general interface are quick to work and snappy to use, and while the battery life isn't great, in the US particularly you're not short of options to charge it.

It's also running the latest version of Android and has some cute usability tricks... if you're willing to make a bit of a change with your phone, the G6 could be a nice place to start.

What we worry most about is LG's past: it has a history of starting something and not following it through. VR content for 2016's headset? Not really. The Rolling Bot? Never made it out the gate. New modules for the G5? Never appeared... so how do we know that the company will work with app developers to improve their wares for its longer screen format?

LG might have signed a death warrant on the success of the G6 for one reason: the price. 

The brand has been pretty clear that it made cost-cutting decisions throughout this phone – for instance, the lower-power chipset or the loss of certain features for certain regions – as it listened to what would actually enhance the consumer's experience and made design decisions accordingly. 

Well, most brands say that. It would be dumb to just create a phone with a random set of features and hope that something sticks – but then again, LG has done that in the past, so it's good that the brand is taking things back to basics.

But then we see sky-high pricing that rivals the very top phones out there, without a key, unique feature to compete. The screen is good, but bested by Samsung. The iPhone is slicker. The Pixel has a better camera. People look for a reason to go for a phone, and nothing sticks out with the G6.

That doesn't mean the G6 isn't innovative – the screen looks great and there's raw power, from the camera to the battery to the general snappiness of the handset, rippling through this phone.

The larger display has been well used for the native apps, and thankfully worries about black bars appearing around the apps are unfounded. You'll need to work with them a little bit to make certain apps run in full-screen, but ultimately the experience is sound and isn't ruined by the new ratio.

There aren't many other new battery optimizations from LG here, but then again it probably didn't need them – with the more powerful and longer-lasting power pack on show users should be able to eke out longer between charges than ever before.

LG has put some smarts into the charging though, with the phone able to read the age and temperature of the battery to make sure the right amount of current goes into the power pack. 

This means degradation will be slower and your G6 will last for longer. That's a Good Thing.

In terms of day to day use, the LG G6 is just, well, fine when it comes to battery performance. It's as good as most on the market, better than the iPhone 7 and about the equivalent of the Samsung Galaxy S8.

In our battery testing, we ran a 90 minute Full HD video with the brightness cranked up to the maximum, and the phone dropped 14% of its power in that time, which isn't the best we've seen, but it's better than average.

The iPhone 7 for comparison dropped 23% in this test, while the Lenovo P2 - which has a big 5,100mAh battery - dropped just 8%.

In real terms, that means you'll get to the end of the day with a little sweat on sometimes, as the power bar can be a little lower than we'd like come 5PM.

The LG G6 rarely ran out of battery, and when it was ensconced in a pocket the power drain was relatively minimal, but overall when in use the drop in battery life for the day was a little more than we'd have liked.

The ways you'll charge your new phone are varied, and a little hard to explain as there will be so many versions of the LG G6 throughout the world. In the US you'll be able to charge this phone wirelessly, with both PMA and WPC standards supported.

Simply put: if there's a wireless charging station around and you live in the United States, you'll be able to charge the G6 on it.

However, the rest of the world isn't getting such an option, in favor of QuickCharge 3.0 to help you juice your phone a little quicker.Whether this is just an excuse remains to be seen – there are many efficiency advantages being touted by Qualcomm in its latest 835 chip – and LG could be just trying to deflect from the decision to use an older (and presumably cheaper) engine in its phone.

However, the rest of the world isn't getting such an option, in favor of QuickCharge 3.0 to help you juice your phone a little quicker.

This is where the inclusion of the Snapdragon 821 processor is going to have an effect too, according to LG, as its engineers have worked with the chipset for longer and have managed to extract more performance out of it, which leads to longer-lasting and less hot handsets.

With this, it very much depends on what you like though. If you're a fan of taking pics of lots of people, then this is a great camera... the wide angle lens is sharp enough and brings in loads of detail.

The square interface hasn't offered anything other than novelty so far, but we've not explored it as a way to take great Instagram photos as yet - which is what the square viewfinder and preview window together would offer.

"Last year saw LG bring us the LG G5, a handset that dared to be different and failed spectacularly in doing so. This resulted in losses for the company’s mobile division in 2015, and lost market share as Samsung extended its lead and Huawei caught up and overtook the Korean manufacturer.
Now LG is back with another flagship. But unlike previous years, this one takes a rather different approach. Past years have seen LG attempt to stand out from the crowd (and compete against Samsung’s blossoming Galaxy S-series) by being different, yet in 2016 the company has arguably done the opposite. Rather than the leather back of the LG G4 or the ill-fated modularity of the LG G5, the G6 is understated with a design that conforms to the current market trends.
The LG G6 design formula is rather simple and straightforward, with a sturdy metal frame paired with a couple different kinds of Gorilla Glass. The front features Gorilla Glass 3 protection (as does the camera lens cover on the rear), while the back cover is made from Gorilla Glass 5. The glass finishes are fingerprint and dust magnets, but this is something we’ve now come to expect from most glass phones out there. Fingerprints on the White model are very difficult to discern, while fingerprints on the Platinum color option are a tad more noticeable. On the Black version, fingerprints are most noticeable.
Unlike previous G-series flagships, the LG G6 features a unibody design, which unfortunately means the company had to forego the removable battery this time around. It’s a small tradeoff for what you get in return, though – an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.
Although the design is new for LG, there are a few flourishes which are atypical of the Korean OEM, including the signature power button on the back that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. It works extremely well, is very fast and accurate to unlock and doesn’t require you to press the button to unlock your phone.
On the top of the device, you’ll find a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, which LG plans on keeping for the foreseeable future as the benefits outweigh removing it. The bottom of the device houses the USB Type-C port and a single speaker, and the right side features the SIM card slot. The volume keys can be found on the left of the device, and not on the back flanking the rear-mounted power button. LG toyed with placing the power button/volume keys on the back panel of its devices for a few years, but it looks like that experiment has come to a close.
Overall, the LG G6 is different from previous LG flagships, and that’s a good thing. Rather than attempting to reinvent the wheel, LG has gone back to basics. Opting for a metal/glass construction is a safe choice that’s proven to work, and that’s why LG went with it. After last year, LG needed safe to appeal to the masses, and the G6 does just this.
The standout feature on the LG G6 is the new 18:9 2:1-aspect ratio screen, which, coupled with some excellent design choices, means LG has managed to fit a 5.7-inch display in a body that’s not much larger than a regular 5.2-inch phone. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus or Google Pixel XL, the LG G6 is significantly smaller. It’s truly a feat of engineering that is much easier to appreciate when you hold and use the phone.
LG has made conscious design choices to enhance the one-handed use of the phone, specifically opting for very narrow bezels on the sides, top and bottom. You’ll also find rounded corners for both the display and the outer frame and the result is a one-handed experience that’s arguably the best of any 5.7-inch phone. LG says the decision to make the display and the frame rounded makes the screen more durable against corner impacts versus a traditional screen with regular corners. The rounded corners do provide a nice aesthetic touch, but as Lanh pointed out, they’re not perfectly rounded and you can still see a little sharpness on the corners. It doesn’t take away from the overall experience, but it’s hard to unsee after you notice it for the first time (sorry if we are the bearer of bad news).
The display is an LCD instead of an OLED panel, but it’s a very good looking display to say the least, and by far the best screen we’ve ever seen on an LG phone. Lanh and I both agree that it has the perfect amount of color and contrast, so it doesn’t appear washed out or oversaturated. Rather curiously, the default out-of-the-box wallpaper, which was developed in partnership with Pantone, doesn’t do the display much justice, but switching it out to one of the others shows off the display in all its glory.
The LG G6 is also the first phone to support both HDR 10 and Dolby Vision, which promises to bring an enhanced viewing experience thanks to a much brighter and more vibrant image. Right now, there’s no content to support either of these standards, but Netflix is expected to update its mobile app to support HDR content in time for the launch of the LG G6, which is likely to be the first of many phones to support these standards.
LG has built in an app scaling feature that lets you force apps to rescale to 18:9, but you won’t use it as much as you might think as it can cause the content to be cut off, which LG does warn you about. Luckily, Netflix’s original series – such as House of Cards – have been shot in 2:1 natively. Plus, as more devices adopt the new standard, it’s likely other producers will follow suit.
Without doubt, the LG G6’s display is fantastic and hopefully a sign of things to come for future smartphone displays. For years, manufacturers have been trying to make screens larger, but this results in larger phones. With the G6’s rounded corners, slim bezels and 18:9 aspect ratio, we finally have a handset that has a large screen without the big footprint we’ve been accustomed to.
No, the G6 doesn’t have an OLED panel, but it’s still incredibly vibrant, colorful and a joy to use. Lanh and I both agree there’s a massive difference between the LG G5 and LG G6 displays and thankfully, there’s no light bleed either, which we’ve noticed on many other LCD panels.
Ahead of the launch of the LG G6, we heard rumors that LG would opt for last year’s Snapdragon 821 processor rather than the new Snapdragon 835, mainly as the latter would require the launch to be delayed several months. As a result, the LG G6 comes equipped with the Snapdragon 821 processor alongside 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU, which is the same package found in the OnePlus 3T and Google’s Pixel XL, the former being the handset we crowned the best smartphone of 2016!
Some people may be disappointed that the LG G6 isn’t powered by the Snapdragon 835, but we’ve really had no issues with performance; the handset handles everything you can throw at it. While performance may be affected by carrier bloat, the unlocked version certainly delivers as far as performance goes. As Lanh put it: it flies… like a G6.
The LG G6 comes equipped with 32GB of storage in most markets, which is expandable by up to 2TB using a microSD card slot. Additional connectivity features include Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, NFC and in some markets, an FM radio. The USB Type-C port is v3.1 compliant and supports USB On-The-Go, meaning you can connect a hard drive or USB stick using a compatible adapter (which isn’t included in the box).
For users in the US, there’s no Quad DAC or model with more than 32GB of storage, but there is wireless charging; the G6 supports both WPC and PMA wireless charging standards. Finally, there’s also a dual SIM model for select markets, again with varying configurations depending on the market. It’s not the first time LG has done this – the LG G5 was also segregated with the B&O Play module not coming to the US at all – and LG tells us it is down to local markets to decide exactly which features the handset gets. For users in Europe and most countries, you’ll get the global model without the additional bells and whistles.
Next to the USB Type-C port on the bottom, you’ll find the single speaker. It seems loud for a single speaker, but like all bottom-mounted speakers, you can block it when using it in one-hand in landscape mode. Putting the audio setup through our testing, we find the speaker has loudness of 63.2dB, which is lower than most flagships and significantly lower than the LG G5 which scored 72.8dB.
The switch to a metal/glass unibody design means the LG G6 has a non-removable 3,300mAh battery, which isn’t the largest we’ve seen on a smartphone but certainly delivers respectable battery life. During our time with the LG G6, we’ve both found that the handset is more than capable of surviving a full day of use on a consistent basis.
One of the perceived benefits of the Snapdragon 835 processor is an apparent boost in battery life of up to 20 percent, but this has yet to be proven. LG’s decision to go with the tried-and-tested Snapdragon 821 certainly seems to have paid off with the battery proving to be reliable and capable of lasting even the heaviest of usage.
Overall, battery enthusiasts might be disappointed at the lack of a removable battery in the LG G6 but the hefty boost in capacity, coupled with software enhancements and a reliable processing package certainly delivers flagship-worthy battery life. Whatever your usage, the LG G6 should see you through at least a full day’s use.
The LG G6 camera has also had a little upgrade this year but it’s not quite what you may have expected; rather than the customary boost in megapixels or pixel size, LG has opted to reduce the regular camera from 16MP to 13MP and boost the wide-angle camera to the same 13MP resolution. Doing so has meant they can also remove the camera bump, resulting in a camera that’s flush with the rest of the body.
Parity between the two cameras is arguably my favorite thing about the LG G6 camera; the LG G5 and the V20 both have a large disparity between the two sensors, with the regular sensor capturing 16MP images while the wide-angle shoots at 8MP. As a result, there’s a noticeable difference in the quality of images captured by both sensors and as LG correctly identified, it made the wide-angle camera the “secondary” camera. As they told us, providing parity between the two cameras means both cameras are now main cameras, and from our time with the LG G6, it certainly delivers on this claim.
They might share the same resolution count but the two cameras are behind two very different lenses; the standard angle is an f/1.8 aperture lens with optical image stabilization and 71-degree field of view while the wide-angle is an f/2.4 lens with 125-degree field of view, which is lacking in both OIS and autofocus. That’s not the only change from last year, with LG also opting to drop the color spectrum sensor as well as swapping out laser autofocus for phase detection autofocus, which works just as well, if not better.
The camera app is mostly the same as previous years but thanks to the 18:9 screen, you have the addition of one of my favorite LG G6 features – the camera carousel. Essentially, this provides a preview on the side of the regular viewfinder that lets you see literally every photo you’ve taken, versus just the one you’d normally see hidden in the corner on other smartphones. The camera carousel is one of the best uses of the wider screen and shows just how useful 18:9 can be.
Elsewhere around the camera interface, you get the standard button controls at the top to switch between the two lenses that we’ve come to expect from LG’s dual cameras. With parity between the two cameras, you can also zoom and change lenses by pinching the display. But, given the fact that you must pinch until that point, you’ll likely find yourself swapping lenses by tapping the button as it’s the fastest and simplest way. The transition between the two lenses is much better than previous years and the middle ground between the two lenses is usable, but you’ll likely find yourself opting to use one of the two lenses rather than the middle ground.
The camera tweaks don’t stop there as LG has also added a new square camera that’s perfect for Instagram and comes with a few different modes built into it. One allows you to snap a photo and immediately see a preview of it on the bottom half of the screen while another lets you take multiple photos or short clips that the camera will stitch together automatically. For those who like putting four photos together in a collage, you can take four different photos in the grid shot mode and the camera will do all the heavy lifting.
Both Lanh and I agree that our favourite is the guide shot mode, which allows you to use a premade template or a previous photo as a guide for taking another photo with the same framing or composition. Once you dig into guide shot however, you see that you can also take multiple shots and turn them into a GIF at the press of a button; it’s a hidden feature that only shows up once you take multiple shots in guide shot mode, but it’s by far my favorite feature of the square camera.
New to the LG G-series is full manual video controls which, until now, had been exclusive to LG’s flagship V-series. Now it looks like LG has finally given users exactly what they wanted. Compared to manual video controls on other smartphones, the LG G6 is miles ahead, with features like focus peaking, hi-fi audio recording and a wind noise filter all making it on-board. For vloggers, video lovers or those who want a little more control over their video, the LG G6’s video recording capabilities definitely deliver.
Without doubt, the LG G6 camera is a lot of fun to use, especially thanks to the wide-angle lens which can really take some breathtaking shots. It’s amazing how much you can fit into the frame over the standard telephoto lens. The quality of the photos themselves are impressive, with excellent detail, vibrant colors, great contrast and overall good dynamic range. There’s a noticeable lack of issues with overexposure of highlights and crushing of shadows that were prevalent in previous LG cameras, so it’s clear the Korean OEM has certainly made a lot of progress with its algorithms and processing.
As fun as the wide-angle lens is, it’s not great in low light which is to be expected from the narrower aperture and lack of OIS compared to the main sensor. In low light conditions, we recommend using the regular angle which can take some equally fantastic shots and produces a much sharper, more colourful and much cleaner image over the wide-angle lens. I personally feel that there’s still a lot to be desired from the low-light performance on the G6, but given this is pre-final software, I’m basing my concerns on that, especially as Lanh’s handset performs much better in low-light conditions.
On the front, you’ve got a 5MP camera which has a wide 100-degree field of view and you can swap between narrow and wide angles, which makes it perfect for group shots. In daylight, this is more than capable, although highlights are often blown out and shots tend to fall apart and are mostly unusable in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. This isn’t overly surprising given it’s the front -facing camera, but something to keep in mind nonetheless.
Overall, the LG G6 camera is a joy to use, and, given the right conditions, it can take truly breathtaking photos. It’s not perfect – no smartphone is, after all – but it delivers quality in abundance. Whether it’s the square camera fun, the two angles or the manual video controls, there’s a lot to like about the LG G6 camera.
At the core of the LG G6, you have Android 7.0 Nougat with LG’s UX 6.0 on top. And like every year, a new flagship means a new iteration of the company’s UI. As a point of note, our pre-release units are running Android 7.0 but we’re led to believe that the LG G6 will ship with the latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box.
The new icons are designed to complement the rounded corners of the display. While Lanh likes them for the uniformity they provide, I personally don’t like them and prefer the natural design of icons. Thankfully, LG provides an option in the home screen settings to display the icons without the backgrounds. This is also where you can enable the app drawer, although it is not enabled by default.
LG has also worked with Pantone to create some interesting wallpapers and this is arguably a point of contention for me personally. Without doubt, the display is fantastic but as mentioned, the default “6” wallpaper doesn’t really show it off. However, there are loads of wallpapers available that truly show off the 18:9 form factor with excellent colors and fantastic composition. If you get the Black, Platinum or the White version, you’ll also find there’s a variant of the default theme to match those colors; on the Black version I’m using, this results in a truly fantastic black-on-black experience.
As part of its push towards the 18:9 screen, LG has also updated its app to show off what’s possible with the new aspect ratio. Apps like the calendar and weather both really show off the two squares stacked on top of each other and the calendar especially, is fantastic in landscape mode. The apps also conform more to Google’s Material Design guidelines than previous years and fit the overall Android experience very well.
Overall, LG’s software has come a long way over the past few years, and the UX 6.0 running on the G6 continues this trend. LG has worked hard to optimize the software for the smoothest experience, there’s very little bloat on our unlocked units and LG’s own apps and wallpapers are fantastic at showing off the new 18:9-aspect ratio on the screen.
So, when can you actually buy this phone? We’re not quite sure yet. LG hasn’t revealed all the pricing and availability details as of yet, but we do know it’s coming to the U.S. sometime this Spring. March 10 is when the handset is coming to Korea, and the current U.S. availability rumors have been pointing to an April 7 release date. We’ll be sure to keep you updated as more information arises.
After the failures of last year, and with the LG V20 still not available in Europe, LG desperately needed the G6 to restore some balance. To do this, they’ve gone back to basics and focused on the things that truly matter to create a solid all-round smartphone, and they’ve certainly nailed it with the G6.
017 is shaping up to be a fantastic year for Android smartphones. With Samsung, Apple, Huawei and others all expected to bring the very best they have this year, the G6 needed to be a success. Luckily, it does just this, and by setting a new standard for flagships in 2017, LG has laid down a marker that other OEMs need to equal or surpass. Simply put, LG’s G6 represents the future of what we should expect from a flagship smartphone.
It performs well, has an excellent camera, flagship-worthy battery life and features that people want, such as wireless charging and water resistance. The new 18:9 screen pushes the envelope of smartphone functionality and combined with the super slim bezels, LG has proven that a big display doesn’t have to mean a big phone.

With Nougat on board, the 18:9 form factor shows just how good it is for multitasking with the split-view in Nougat proving to be a lot more useful on an 18:9 aspect ratio than the traditional 16:9 ratio, mainly due to the extra amount you can see in each app.



Press and hold the on-screen home key and you’ll no longer get Google Now as in previous years; instead, the LG G6 is the first non-Pixel Android phone to run Google’s Assistant out of the box and provides some very-welcome competition for Google’s flagship Pixel XL. Sure, Assistant is available on other devices running Nougat and Marshmallow, which takes the shine off it being available on the LG G6, but it’s a nice feature to have nonetheless.

The new LG UX 6.0 essentially brings a new coat of paint with more natural colors, but still retains the features that we’ve come to expect from LG’s phones. The app icons have been updated to square icons with rounded corners for a much more uniform look – and the additional benefit of having square icons on a perfectly square half of the display – while pop-up menus within applications also have rounded corners.

For those wondering, we’re both capable of achieving 5 hours’ worth of screen on time off a single charge and that’s without really trying to hit those numbers. With some tweaks to usage, it would certainly be feasible to expect six or even seven hours of screen of time.

How does the G6 stack up to our Android Authority battery tests? How does it compare to the competition? In our quick battery test, which tests Wi-Fi browsing, video playback and gaming for 90 minutes and extrapolates the results to simulate a full day’s usage, the LG G6 scored a very respectable 7 hours and 51 minutes. By way of comparison, the Google Pixel XL scores 5 hours and 52 minutes, the LG G5 scored 6 hours and 31 minutes and the Galaxy S7 Edge scores 4 hours and 16 minutes.

Our next test looks at Wi-Fi browsing with each phone charged to full, the display set to 200 nits brightness and the handset placed a meter from the router with no app data syncing. A custom web script is then run inside our testing app and drains the handset right down to empty. In this test, the LG G6 lasted for 8 hours and 31 minutes, while the Pixel XL scored 10 hours and 38 minutes, the G5 lasted for 7 hours and 51 minutes and the Galaxy S7 Edge scored 8 hours and 11 minutes.

Another popular use case is video or media playback and for this test, the same testing conditions applied as above with a custom video file set to play on loop inside our testing app. For video playback, the LG G6 scores 8 hours and 56 minutes while the Pixel XL lasts for 7 hours and 1 minute, the LG G5 for 9 hours and 26 minutes and the Galaxy S7 Edge for 8 hours and 14 minutes.

Our final test is arguably the most taxing as it engages the entire processing package. Gaming is traditionally a sure-fire way to drain your battery rather quickly so in this test, we set a game to repeat its demo mode with the rest of the testing conditions the same. For pure gaming, the LG G6 lasts a very respectable 5 hours and 21 minutes, while the Pixel XL comes in at 4 hours and 43 minutes, the LG G5 at 3 hours and 58 minutes and the Galaxy S7 Edge at 3 hours and 46 minutes.

For the times when you do need to top it up or when you need a quick boost, the LG G6 supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and the included charger can charge the handset from empty to full in 104 minutes. This is on par with most handsets that support Quick charging, but does pale in comparison to Huawei’s Supercharge and OnePlus’ Dash Charge, which are both significantly faster.

During Lanh’s testing, he found that even with a heavy usage day – such as using the camera lot with a few hours of gaming – the phone still has 20 to 25 percent battery life left at the end of the day. Personally, I’ve been very impressed by the battery life. On more than one occasion, the G6 has lasted me a full day and almost all of the second. Even on days with heavy usage, I’ve not had to top the battery up at all.

The headphone jack outputs at 0.396 volts, which is low compared to many phones but better than the LG G5 (0.313 volts), while the noise level of -95.5dBA is on par with most flagships as well. Overall, the audio experience may not seem the best on paper, but it doesn’t disappoint in actual usage. While we would have liked dual stereo-speakers, it is certainly more than acceptable as it is.

On the hardware front, there’s likely to be some contention as LG has opted for different SKUs in different markets, each with different feature sets. The global version has the features listed above but in certain Asian markets, the base model has 64GB storage while other Asian models have the Quad DAC found in the LG V20.

Don’t miss: LG G6 vs Sony Xperia XZ Premium vs Huawei P10 Plus

Like Google’s flagship, the LG G6 is smooth and responsive, with almost no perceptible lag. As this is pre-final software, we’re putting the few minor glitches down to the software and we’d expect the final version to be faultless or close to it. We’ve both had a couple of small software bugs – myself with freezing and Lanh with connectivity – but these should be fixed in the final software – we’re merely mentioning them here for total transparency.

The Adreno 530 proves to be a very solid graphics chipset with the gaming experience on par with all major flagships to date. Running graphically intensive games, there are no noticeable dropped frames and the LG G6 is certainly capable of handling all the games you throw at it. With Vulkan support also built in, you’ll also be able to run most games that developers put out in the coming months and years.

Overall, there’s a lot to like about the LG G6 display. Thanks to HDR and Dolby Vision support, it’s at least future-proofed for a few years to come. It may not be the most accurate screen, nor an AMOLED panel, but LG has done more than enough to convince us that 18:9 is the future of smartphone screens and not just a gimmick.

Like most flagships, there’s also an always-on display which does the job and shows you notifications without first making you turn the screen on. The company has also included a new brighter screen option for the always-on display, but Lanh and I both agree – we’re not entirely sure what this feature accomplishes. It doesn’t appear to make the always-on display any brighter. Now, this could be due to the fact that both devices are not running final software, so we’ll be sure to update this review if we notice any changes.

Putting it through our testing, we found the display to have a max manual brightness of 556 nits, which is boosted to a very respectable 663 nits when auto brightness is engaged under direct light. In sunlight, this is likely to be even higher and we’ve had no issues with legibility in all conditions. Its color temperature of 8281 Kelvin is rather on the cool side resulting in a blue-ish tinge to the whites – which is common to all LCD panels – but this isn’t immediately noticeable and the display certainly looks fantastic.

Spending time with the LG G6’s display does raise a larger issue around the aspect ratio, especially if it’s to become the standard for phones going forward. When you’re consuming content that’s native to the 18:9 ratio, the experience is fantastic… but when you’re watching content that’s 16:9 by default (as almost all content is right now), or using an app that doesn’t scale to the new ratio, you have awkward black bars on either side.

Since the G6’s Quad HD panel sports an unusual aspect ratio, that means LG packed in a few hundred more pixels than you’d see on a normal 5.7-inch display. If you split the screen in half, you essentially get two perfectly symmetrical squares stacked on top of each other. LG have made some tweaks to the software to take full advantage of this. In landscape mode, for instance, the display splits up into two squares side-by-side; this arrangement makes multitasking a bit easier as you’re able to see more of each app.

Personally, I’ll happily take the enhanced durability over a removable battery.

Yet, there is one way the LG G6 is different; its 5.7-inch screen with a unique 18:9 aspect ratio. With other phones expected to also offer the same aspect ratio display later this year, the G6 could prove to be a forward-thinking phone rather than yet another one-hit wonder from LG.

LG G6 pricing and availability: what we know so far
LG G6 officially announced: everything you need to know
Is a unique display and solid –  if muted – package enough to make the LG G6 a must-buy? With a package that’s mostly identical to the LG V20, should you buy a G-series or a V-series? Does LG’s decision to ditch the gimmicks and focus on a solid experience pay off? Find out, in our full LG G6 review.
",http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/
"Cutting corners - it's the story of the LG G6's life. And we mean this both literally and figuratively. Literally because its display doesn't have right angles, it's soft arcs instead. And figuratively because the G6 doesn't come with the screaming hardware on the market, but makes do with a few-months-old chipset and 'just' 4GB of RAM. What happened to 'flagship'?
What happened is that LG is taking a different spin on the term. The G6 is the one that will sell the most, so they've redefined flagship to mean that. So while LG held back on equipping the phone with the latest hardware, they've focused on usability. Many will think (a few of us here as well) that's just downplaying the fact that Samsung won't let anyone use the Snapdragon 835 before the Galaxy S8 comes out, but let's face it - LG's marketing team did have to maneuver around the issue somehow.  As for the ultimate in specs, LG says we should look for them in the V-series from now on. How convenient it is that the V20 is due for a refresh in the fall, when the S8 will be in the rearview mirror.  Read on, however, and you'll find out that LG can build a remarkably strong case for the decisions it's made (or the ones being forced upon it) for the G6. Sure, it's only the Snapdragon 821 chipset that's driving the G6 and not the upcoming S835, but it's not exactly a slouch, the S821. Also, let's not forget that it is, after all, Qualcomm's still-current top model.  Another eyebrow-raiser is the choice of the Sony IMX258 camera sensor, the imager of choice for a few dozen smartphones, going as far as two years back. This includes prominent smartphone models as well as models you've likely never heard of. They span across a price range of $150-$350, which is less than half of the LG G6's asking price. It's obviously not a flagship cameraphone sensor, but remember - the term's been redefined. Also the G6 does have two of those IMX258s, so that should count for something.  It's also still the same concept - a crazy ultra-wide-angle camera accompanies the regular one. True, the coverage has been shrunk a little on both, but you now get the same 13MP resolution on each of them, so the wide-angle shooter doesn't feel like it's getting neglected.
But best of all - that display. We all want larger displays, but no one is particularly fond of the extra bulk that goes with one. That's what LG's surveys showed too, so its designers went out and stretched the screen to cover most of the device's front - the 5.7-inch 18:9 aspect panel fits in the same body footprint as the G5's (admittedly, the G5 is not a screen-to-body ratio contest winner, but still). Oh, and the corners here are cut for a reason beyond appearance, but more on that later.
If you did a little more than briefly skim the list of key features, you can't have missed the numerous region-specific bits. Why LG, why does the world not get wireless charging (US only) and the Hi-Fi Quad DAC (South Korea only)? And does either of the two make up for the lack of an FM radio receiver, which those particular markets won't be getting?
We're also still trying to figure out what to make of the 'value proposition' phrase LG used to describe the G6 when we were first introduced to it. The $700 price that's been floating around is very much flagship-grade, and in the classic, pre-redefinition (some word that is) sense of the term. But by the looks of it, the Galaxy S8 will be even pricier, and the Pixel and the iPhone already are too (some versions on some markets, at least) - so LG might have a point there.  You can't, however, judge a product's value for money before establishing its real-world merits first. That's exactly what we intend to do on the following pages, starting with an overview of the hardware.
The LG G6 comes in a much understated black box that at least doesn't make promises it can't keep. Inside it, you'll find a charger rated at 9V/1.8A that should be QuickCharge 3.0 compliant. It's got a regular Type-A USB port, and the bundle contains a Type-A to Type-C cable - in other words, LG isn't yet switching to USB-C on both ends of the cable, which we appreciate.
here was no headset in our box, but we can't be certain if that's going to be the case in all markets - there's plenty of region-dependent bits about the G6, so why not that. There's certainly an empty space right by the charger that could fit a pair of earbuds.  
The G6 measures 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm, which means it's actually smaller in every direction compared to the G5. It's also more than a centimeter shorter than the V20 and 6.2mm narrower than the current V-series phablet, itself with a 5.7-inch display.
Not all 5.7-inch displays are created equal, however. The G6's 18:9 aspect ratio means the panel is actually narrower than not only a 16:9 5.5-inch display (like the one on the Galaxy S7 edge), but also the 5.3-inch G5. So while it is technically true that the G6 packs a 5.7-inch display in a smaller body than the 5.3-inch G5, you have got to keep in mind where that comes from - there's no magic here.  The G6 weighs 163g, 4g heavier than the G5, and 11g lighter than the V20. The Galaxy S7 edge is 6g lighter than the G6, but you'll hardly notice the difference.
he G5 had a removable chin that gave access to the user-replaceable battery and could be swapped out for one of a few modules called Friends. The G5's take on modularity didn't catch on, and LG decided not to pursue it, not now at least.  The G5 had a metal back, which however was covered by plastic or primer (whatever you like to call it) and it also had an unsightly camera hump on the rear, which LG tried to turn into a design accent.  What we're trying to say is that the G5's design just didn't click.
Not so with the G6. The G6's more orthodox build with a solid aluminum frame sandwiched between two pieces of glass looks much better even if it has no Friends to hang out with. Now, that would be a sad, miserable, narcissistic life if it was a person, but it's a phone, the G6, and it's a good thing.  And while having glass front and back is an often exploited design approach, the G6 wears it like no other and manages to look unique.  A lot of that novelty comes from the display. It's certainly an eye-catcher but the order of noticing that things aren't quite the way you're used to. It goes something like this: (1) 'Ooh, nice, slim bezels!' and then (2) 'No way, the corners are rounded!' to finally, (3) 'Hmm, that's one tall screen'! And that's before you even pick the phone up.
The bezels are, indeed, impressively slim. LG's research has shown that users still prefer to have some chin at the base of the phone so the bottom bezel is more generous than the top one. It has to do with handling, they say, and we're inclined to agree. But could it also be related to the placement of other components like the USB-C port and the loudspeaker? It might, but who cares - we tried flipping the phone upside down and it's a bit of a pain to use - so LG has got it right.
Moving on to the curved screen corners. You see, with such a slim frame around the display, the precious LCD is perilously close to the physical corners of the phone. And it just so happens that in half of all drops a phone lands on its corner (LG's statistics, the precise number they quote is 48%).  A panel that ends in right angles will suffer from stress concentration upon impact and will be more likely to fail. On the other hand, a panel that's chamfered (because it's really chamfered, 1.7x1.7mm, and not actually rounded - apparently software takes care of that) will better disperse the energy of the impact and thus be more likely to survive.
All of this is, of course, applicable to every other phone, it's just that on the G6 the issue is made worse by the close proximity of the display to the physical extremities. LG had a few competitors' phones with cracked screens in its presentation slides to prove their point but you didn't hear this from us.  And then we get to the fact that the display is taller than the conventional 16:9 aspect ratio. It is, in fact, 18:9 and the reason why it's not being called a 2:1 ratio is so that its name immediately makes it obvious that it's been extended vertically compared to what you may be used to.
As the story goes, LG asked a bunch of people how they feel about display size and everyone replied they want more, but generally no one was thrilled about the extra bulk the bigger screen brings. Seems plausible - if they had asked us, that's pretty much the response they would have gotten. So LG went ahead and stretched the display taller, and made it so that would cover almost the entire front of the phone - with that chin provision, of course.  
The thing is, a 5.7-inch display in 18:9 ratio is actually smaller in area than a 5.7-inch display in 16:9 ratio - 83.8sq.cm vs. 89.6sq.cm if you want specifics. In fact, the LG G6 total screen area equals that of a conventional 5.5-inch 16:9 screen. However, the G6's panel is 64.7mm wide, while that same standard-issue 5.5-incher would be 68.5mm wide, and a 5.7-inch 16:9 screen would be 71.0mm wide.  We all know how it is really the width that makes a large phone difficult to use with one hand. So the G6's approach to offer the most display in the easiest to handle package makes perfect sense. It's just all too easy to overlook the fact that it's a different 5.7 inches you're getting here, so we'd just like to point this out. Splitting hairs - may be, being thorough - always.  Let's move to the G6's back now. It's a slab of Gorilla Glass 5, which should be more shatter-resistant if a little easier to scratch than previous generations. This particular Ice Titanium color version we have here might fool you from a distance into thinking it's brushed steel - it isn't. It's glass, alright.
There's a cutout for the camera duo, but the setup now sits flush with the cover as opposed to the G5's camera bulge. It's a design choice we love.  Underneath the cameras you'll find the fingerprint sensor, easily accessible with either forefinger.
By the way, the frame is great. It's a pretty thick one, as recent frames go so you touch more metal leading to a distinct high-end feel. It also allows for more secure purchase on the device, especially helpful when picking it up from a table - an exercise that sucks with the Galaxy S7 edge, for instance.  One less thrilling aspect of the G6's design (and/or craftsmanship) is the volume buttons. They tend to wobble and have quite limited travel - overall far from what you'd call a positive click action.
Speaking of the frame, there's some clever engineering that's gone into it as well, again from the perspective of durability. The plastic slits that you'll find in the vicinity of the corners have actually been moved as far away from them as possible to reduce the stress on them in the event of impact. That keeps the slits from cracking as cracked slits is how you ruin the phone's waterproofing in time, something we honestly haven't thought about until LG pointed it out.  Oh, we're only now mentioning this? Yes, the LG G6 is IP68-certified for water and dust protection. And the bestest bit about it is that it will also survive dips in sea water, which LG representatives explicitly stated at the press event we went to, and yet we can't find it written anywhere on specs pages. It's probably a warranty nightmare, so they're staying on the safe side by not listing it. In any case, and we can't stress this enough, it's a good idea to never get your phone wet in the first place.
If you do get it wet and want to charge it, and you have the US version, you're in luck - wireless charging will save the day. Otherwise you'll need to wait for the USB Type-C port to dry up before plugging.
One of the LG G6's most distinctive features, its 18:9 aspect Full Vision display is a true beauty. The 5.7-inch panel with a novel aspect ratio offers virtually the same area as a 5.5-inch conventional 16:9 display, and is, in fact, as wide as a 5.2-inch 16:9 screen, only taller.  The 2,880x1,440px resolution on this diagonal results in a 564ppi density, which beats the Galaxy S7 edge's 534ppi, but is slightly less than the S7's 577ppi. However, the G6's subpixel arrangement is a classic RGB with equal number of subpixels for each primary color, making it even sharper per pixel than the Super AMOLEDs' Diamond Pentile subpixel layout. Not that it matters all that much at these densities for naked-eye viewing, and the G6 won't support Google's Daydream VR, sadly.
It's all good on the other fronts, though. For starters, the G6 boasts spectacular contrast for an LCD - upwards of 2000:1. The G5 before it wasn't too shabby either with its high 1800s, but man, was that display dim.  Not the G6, though - 468nits in manual mode and a hundred more when you're in auto and the environment is bright. The Huawei P10 and Xperia XZ (the original one, not the recent Premium) can put out a few dozen more, and the iPhone 7 Plus goes to 681nits in auto, but none of those can match the G6's contrast, not by a long stretch.  Minimum brightness is 4.1nits, so it'll be easy on the eyes if you're using it in a dark setting.  
Sunlight legibility is excellent as well. One of the best LCDs in this respect, the G6's display is on par with the iPhone 7 Plus, but the Xperia XZ and LG's own V20 are still somewhat superior. The G6 is way better than the G5, so there's that too.  
The G6's color reproduction is reasonably accurate, posting an average DeltaE of 4. Whites and grays exhibit a pronounced shift towards blue, and grayscale DeltaE is the highest at around 9. It's a marked improvement in accuracy compared to the G5, where average DeltaE was 5.6 and the maximum was 12.7. Next to the V20's 5.1 and 9.5, the G6 still wins.  On the subject of colors, the G6 is compliant with both Dolby Vision and HDR10 standards. Among other things, the former means the G6 is capable of displaying 12-bit color (or 68 billion colors), while HDR limits that to measly 10 bits and 1 billion colors, give or take.  In practice (and that's LG's data, so if they had more to work with, we're sure they'd mention it), the total available content at the moment is 10 original series and 5 Marvel series on Netflix that adhere to both standards, while on Amazon Video you're looking at 1 original series and 10 movies in Dolby Vision, and 16 original series and 23 movies in HDR10. So while it's great that the display supports both standards, the feature is not exactly a gamechanger. And also last time we checked on Netflix, the G6 was not among the supported devices for HDR video so we hope they change that by the time the phone hits the market or the feature won't be worth much.
The LG G6 supports Cat.12 LTE, courtesy of Qualcomm's modem, with 3-carrier aggregation for theoretical download speeds up to 600Mbps and uploads up to 150Mbps. Ours is a single-SIM version, but some markets will get dual-SIM too.  There's of course Wi-Fi ac with Wi-Fi direct and DLNA, and wireless screen sharing is supported to both Miracast and Chromecast devices. Bluetooth is the latest available version 4.2, and there's GPS, GLONASS and BDS for positioning. You also get NFC.  Our unit also has an FM radio receiver, which G6s bound for the US, Canada, and South Korea won't be getting. Also we've probably gotten the reviewer's bonus as we have both the FM radio and the wireless charging, which shouldn't theoretically be present on the same unit.  The G6 charges via a USB-C port, but it also adheres to the USB 3.1 spec for fast data transfer - all too often manufacturers just use the symmetrical port for its convenience but miss making use of the faster speed transfers it offers and only comply to USB 2.0 spec. Well, not LG anyway.  MirrorLink is supported too, for connection to your car's infotainment system via USB.  There's a good ol' 3.5mm analog audio jack on board too.
The LG G6 is powered by a 3,300mAh battery - a significant upgrade over last year's G5 and its 2,800mAh. The G6 has a larger display, you'll counter, but the battery capacity has been upped by 18% while screen area is just 8% more now. In fact, the G6 packs more juice than the V20 (3,000mAh), which has a larger display to light up - 5.7"" in 16:9 is more area than 5.7"" in 18:9, plus the V20 has that ticker screen on top. The G6's battery, however, is sealed in, unlike both the G5 and the V20.
Anyway, all this is to preface that we expected better battery life from the G6 than what we got out of the G5 and V20, neither of which were particularly impressive in this respect. And indeed, that turned out to be the case.  
With that in mind, the G6 is good for 22 and a half hours of voice calls on a single charge in our testing environment - 5h more than the G5, and 3h more than the V20. In both comparisons the endurance is actually better on the G6 than the proportional increase in capacity - so great, then.  The G6 also manages to outlast its two siblings by an hour in Wi-Fi web browsing - 8:31h for the new G vs. 7:35h for both the G5 and the V20. It's not a tiny improvement, but it's not amazing either - the Pixel XL can keep reloading web pages for another hour after the G6 has quit, and the Galaxy S7 edge's time in this test is 10:35h (though, for rather obvious reasons, we don't have the numbers for the S8). The OnePlus 3T is close to the G6 in this test - 8:43h.  In video playback the G6 will last a whopping 6 minutes more than the G5. Seriously, though, 10 and half hours is a pretty good number, especially when you put it up next to the V20's 8 hours. The Pixel XL can do 11:09h, which is like an extra TV episode or so, so it's not that big of a deal. The OnePlus 3T's 13:23h time does mean significantly better binge-watching capabilities, but the champ remains the Galaxy S7 edge, which lasted over 15 hours of looping videos, and that's after Nougat sliced a large chunk off its surreal Marshmallow stamina.  Dialing in those numbers in our formula produces a 72h overall Endurance rating with the always on display turned off. Switch on the feature and you're looking at a lower number, because stand-by consumption gets higher (duh) and it is included in the calcs even if it doesn't get a field in the score card.
However, and we've always tried to point that out, the effect of the always on display consumption can vary wildly depending on usage - it's one thing if the phone is held in your pocket (where it will eventually turn off the AOD on its own), it's completely different if it stays on the table in front of you and the ambient lighting is strong enough that it needs to crank up the brightness higher. That, as it turns out, is also a setting in the always on display menu - you can actually tell the phone to keep the always on feature brighter unlike with the G5. Whatever you decide on that, the overall effect of the AOD on your battery life is probably not that big of an issue as it may appear so just deal with it and enjoy the extra functionality. Okay, we got that out of our system.  LG states that the G6 is Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 compatible and bundles a charger to go do the job. It's rated at 9V/1.8A and a 30min charging session gets the G6 from flat to 47%. LG has also optimized its charging algorithms to fine-tune the charging process depending on the battery's age and current temperature thus improving the battery's long-term life. We get the feeling it might be something along the lines of Qnovo tech implemented in Sony Xperia phones.  Our unit also happens to be the US version, so we're blessed to have wireless charging support built-in. Since there's no wireless charging pad bundled, we tried a few we have lying around and it's a painfully slow process best suited to overnight charging. We don't have a Samsung fast wireless charger handy, and even then we're not really sure if the two devices would communicate that higher speed charging Samsung can deliver to its own phones. So until LG comes out with a fast wireless charger of its own, just assume that wireless charging is not for those of you who maybe in a hurry.
The G6 runs on Android 7.0 Nougat with an LG custom layer on top. LG calls it Full-screen UX to further emphasize the uniqueness of the display. It's leaning towards the use of two squares one on top of the other (or side by side when held in landscape) where that makes sense for the particular app. A few stock apps benefit from the squares - the Music app, the Calendar, and here and there in the contacts.
First things first, though. While the V20 phablet has a secondary display to show the time and notifications, the G6 relies on an always on display to do the same. You can have one of three designs for the always on display and we'd gladly sacrifice the signature for a date. Notifications from all apps can be shown. You can also set up a time period when the feature will be turned off.
he G6's lockscreen is nigh identical to the one of the V20. You get two shortcuts in the bottom corners by default - to the dialer and the camera. You can, however, have up to 5 shortcuts there, to apps of your own choosing. The lockscreen will also give you a weather update by a live wallpaper with raindrops or snowflakes falling down (that pretty much sums up the weather we've been having lately).  Nougat's interactive bundled notifications are here too - one of the great additions to the OS this generation. You wont be able to act upon them without unlocking the phone, though.
Native split screen multitasking has arrived with Nougat. Some phone makers have their custom versions (including LG itself), but with this one coming straight from Google, we can finally start talking about wider adoption and app support.  Many (but not all) apps can work in split-screen mode. You can use it in either portrait and landscape, but note that the dividing line has very limited adjustment range - in portrait it can be in one of three positions (50/50, 60/40-ish and 40/60), and in landscape it's just half-half. When an app needs a keyboard, the other app is squished into a small space to give room to the keyboard.  Note: from the Developers options, you can force Android to enable split-screen multitasking for all apps. There are no guarantees they will work properly, though. Also from here, you can make all apps movable to the microSD card.  In split screen view, the Home button shows your homescreen but does not dismiss the apps - the app switcher button shows the split screen icon and double tapping it brings back the two. This is great since normally you can only pick apps from the app switcher rolodex for split screen use, but in this state, any app you launch from the homescreen goes straight into split screen mode.
Yes, yes, the G6 is powered by the Snapdragon 821, a slightly beefed up version of the 820 that was all the rage last year. The Snapdragon 835 is right around the corner, but Samsung has dibs on it for the Galaxy S8, allegedly, and LG couldn't have any.
LG is trying to spin this predicament into an advantage by saying user experience ranks higher than raw power, and we understand the logic behind such an approach. They've had plenty of time to optimize for the S821, LG says, so the G6 should be just fine with a chipset that's not exactly cutting edge.  And in our experience that's indeed the case, though we haven't seen the S835 in a production device to know just how much we're missing with the S821.  LG does indeed have some tangible improvements to show off on the G6. Tangible, if you take the phone apart, that is, to reveal its Advanced heat pipe (capital A - it's a name, sort of). LG's advanced touch is a copper plate that sits on top of the SoC, thus providing more contact area for the heat pipe to take away... heat from the chip. LG's internal testing has shown it to bring a 10% reduction in temperature under sustained gaming load, and in our testing the G6 never got uncomfortably hot.  Anyway, moving on to the benchmarks. As usual, we kick off with GeekBench for some CPU performance comparisons. In the single-core test the G6 outperforms key rivals Galaxy S7 edge and HTC U Ultra, both running on the original S820, and Google Pixel XL with a slightly underperforming S821 implementation. The OnePlus 3T makes the best case for the S821, scoring on par with the Exynos 8890 inside the (other) S7 edge and the Kirin 960s in the Huawei Mate 9 and P10.
In the multi-core test the Kirin 960 claims what rightfully belongs to it. Only the Exynos-equipped S7 edge tries to keep up, but the Snapdragons are way behind. Still, the G6 posts one of the better scores here for team Qualcomm.
The G6 storms through Antutu, losing only to the OnePlus 3T and the Moto Z Force, of this select group. The V20 is close by as is the Pixel XL, but the G5 and assorted Galaxy S7 edges are lower down the Antutu chart.
Basemark OS II 2.0 isn't as favorable to the G6 though. In this compound benchmark that assesses overall performance (like Antutu), LG's latest isn't LG's greatest, losing to the V20, but beating the G5. Minimal margins both ways, but what's worth pointing out is that the three LGs place last among these top-class competitors.
Switching to graphics-only exercises, the G6 isn't quite living up to potential in Basemark ES 3.1. It inches ahead of the V20 (S820), but the G5 (S820) does better in this test while other Snapdragons 821 like the Pixel XL and OnePlus 3T post even higher numbers.
All in all, the G6 does very well in CPU-intensive tasks, and is below average in graphics-specific tests. Depending on who you ask, it's either a top performer overall (Antutu) or just hanging in there with the others (Basemark OS II 2.0). In any case, we didn't experience any hiccups in our interaction with the phone, which, honestly, is a weird to say about a top-class chip like the S821.
The LG G6 will be available in both single-SIM and dual-SIM versions, only not in all markets. Ours is the single-SIM one.
The G6 scored a Good mark in our loudspeaker test. This puts it on par with the G5 and V20, as well as the iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S7 edge, and OnePlus 3T. The Pixel XL can pump out more decibels, though. Output quality is good all the way to the max setting, but bass isn't particularly boomy.
The G6 may not have the V20's three mics, but two of them are obviously enough for the HD Audio Recorder app. It adjusts the source mic depending on orientation, so when you hold it in portrait it's the top one only, while in landscape both mics work.
LG G6's Gallery app supports Albums and Timeline views. In both, you can pinch zoom to change the size of thumbnails and in Timeline view this has the added effect of moving between photos grouped by day, month or year.
The Memories screen takes photos and videos and creates a short video out of them (the content is grouped by time and location). Collages and slideshows take just a few taps to create and then the Play on other device option will use Miracast to send your media to your TV.
South Korea gets a QuadDAC in the G6, the world gets a DAC. The music player is just the same though. With DLNA and cloud support (same as the Gallery: Drive, Box, Dropbox, and OneDrive), accessing your music library is a breeze.
In a weird turn of events our otherwise US version of the G6 (as evidenced by the wireless charging support) has an FM radio receiver as well. We don't know the implications of that and we won't be pondering too much on it.
There's no dedicated video player, you launch videos from the Gallery or the File browser, which is fine by us. Both apps have cloud support. You get thumbnails for seeking preview, a screenshot shortcut in the interface, and a GIF maker (5, 10, or 15 seconds length).
The LG G6 doesn't have the impressive loudness of the V20 either with headphones or with an active external amplifier, but it's still above average in both parts of our test.
The LG G6 is equipped with a couple of 13MP cameras on its back. Compare and contrast to the previously used setup on both the G5 and V20, where the primary one was a 16MP unit, while the wide-angle only got half as many pixels.
On the G6 both cameras actually use the same exact sensor - the Sony IMX258. There's nothing striking about it - it's a Type 1/3.06"" imager with 1.12µm pixels and phase detection autofocus. In fact, it's typically used in midrangers from Chinese makers. That said, we've seen it perform admirably on the Xiaomi Mi 4c, for instance, so we avoided jumping to conclusions. That sensor is in a native 4:3 ratio - a principal difference from the older setups with 16:9 aspects.
It's still the same shared viewfinder for stills and video, which means you can't know your video framing before hitting the record button. On a more positive note, the G6 has gotten the manual mode from the V20 (minus the directional audio, for lack of mics). It's better laid out than on the G5 and allows for tweaking white balance by color temperature, exposure compensation, ISO and shutter speed. One thing that's missing on the G5 is focus peaking in manual focus, but the G6 adds that too.
From the mode selector, other than Auto, Manual photo, and Manual video, you now haw a Square option. Also available as a separate app icon on the homescreen (Square Camera), it's LG trying to come up with use cases for the 2:1 display.
Square Camera has modes of its own, the usefulness ranges from... Well, we don't find them particularly practical. Snapshot leaves half the screen as a viewfinder (for taking square photos, obviously) while the other half gives you a preview (technically, post-view) of the shot as soon as you take it. A convenient shortcut to Instagram pops up too, If you were wondering where that 1:1 photo was meant for.
The fourth mode is Guide shot, which displays an overlay of a template image over the viewfinder so you can recreate the same framing. You can fine tune the opacity of the overlay. We can imagine this mode might actually be useful for something. Not exactly sure what, but something.
First up, check out some shots we took with the G6 while still in mid-MWC. Tourist photography and some low-light shots to get us going, with the same scenes captured with both cameras for you to get a sense of the differences in coverage.
Now, we liked the G6 on the spot, so we figured we won't leave Barcelona without it, and took it with us to headquarters instead. The standardized set of samples will follow, of course, again in both 71° and 125° field of view.
As you can tell from both sets of samples, the newest in the G-series still takes great photos, despite a move to a smaller sensor which we ourselves almost called midrange a few paragraphs earlier. It resolves a lot of detail, but does have a rather heavy-handed approach to sharpening. Sure, you can see each and every tile and brick's outline, but it's a touch too much.
Inevitably, you run into high-contrast scenarios where only HDR mode would help. You can leave it to the phone to determine whether HDR is needed and set it to Auto, or you can engage it yourself. Our example below is, indeed, rather extreme, and no HDR mode can capture the entire dynamic range of the scene, but it is a good test.
The G6 is capable of shooting good, high-res panoramas - it's using the entire sensor height minus whatever pixels it needs to cancel out because your sweep wasn't perfectly level, so you're looking at images around 4,000px tall. Now they're not as sharp as that resolution might suggest, but there's a lot of detail. Stitching isn't flawless though - look at the building behind the red post in the rightmost quarter of the frame.
Our Photo compare is the go-to place for comparing resolution, fine detail rendering and color reproduction in a standardized environment. We've pre-selected the G5 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, but you can choose your own set of phones to pit against the G6.
The G6's selfie shooter is listed as 5MP, but that's half the story. Just like the rear cameras, it can shoot in both wide-angle (100°) and normal mode (unspecified coverage). Only it's the one sensor that it's got to do this.
The G6 records videos up to 4K resolution with both of its rear cams. There's also 1080p recording in both 30fps and 60fps, the regular 16:9 kind. However, you also get 1080p in 18:9 ratio - 2,160x1,080px resolution, just what you wanted for that 18:9 TV you have at home. Not.
In 1080p (both 18:9 and 16:9, but not in 60fps) there is also electronic stabilization. It works on both the normal and wide camera too. It is very effective at smoothing out both handshake and the shake induced from walking, and doesn't do blunders while trying to catch up when panning. Naturally, as all such systems, it limits the field of view.
Cutting corners usually has bad implications. But hey, we'd take the G6's chamfered display corners any day if they make the phone that extra bit more likely to live through a drop out of our clumsy hands. Because that display is one true gem, and we'd like to keep it crack free and in working order.
Now, the 18:9 ratio isn't all that great if most of your viewing constitutes 16:9 YouTube videos. It's not ideal for general purpose photo viewing either, particularly of 4:3 photos, which the G phone now makes natively. But elongated screens seems to be the direction in which all major players are headed, and LG is leading the way.
Battery life is a marked improvement compared to both the G5 and V20, and the G6 achieves a 72h Endurance rating. Still, the high-end competitors last as much or longer in most disciplines.
The selfie camera appears to be the same one from the V20 - wide and normal modes from the same sensor, not great but decent detail.
First up, if you insist on the ultra wide-angle camera, there's no one else other than than LG that offers that. But LG itself has a couple more models with it - the V20 and G5. Neither matches the G6 in battery life, but on both you can just swap in a freshly charged battery unlike the G6. If you're a sucker for add-ons, it's G5 all the way. If you feel like the ticker display of the V20 can be useful, well then - V20. The V20 also has more actual display area than the G6 in a more widely used 16:9 format. Neither the G5, nor the V20 are water and dust resistant, and the G6 is. The newest model is also arguably the best looking of this bunch. However, there's one area where the G6 can't compete with either one - for its asking price you can have up to two full G5s in some markets or a V20 and a substantial sum to spare.
If you're willing to concede the wide-angle cam, an entire world of possibilities opens up to you. Starting with the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, it's still one looker of a smartphone. You can use it for VR, albeit not Google's Daydream, but Samsung's own Oculus-powered GearVR platform - if you want VR, the G6 has nothing to offer. The S7 edge has longer battery life going for it, as well as a lower price - lower by up to 200€. And with the upcoming S8, the S7 can only get cheaper.
Those 4:3 photos are otherwise quite good, even if they only fill two thirds of the screen. That Sony sensor isn't pure perfection, but it's been around long enough for engineers to make the most of it. Even if a little oversharpened and slightly noisy, the photos from the main cam are detailed and with pleasing rich colors. The coverage of the wide-angle cam makes pretty much any scene look dramatic, and with a proper sensor now you get more detail.

The main criticisms against the G6 concern the chipset. Well, the Snapdragon 821 is just fine. Really. It's the best chip Qualcomm has out at the moment, and it's what LG used. It's very likely the S835 will be slightly easier on the battery and a little more powerful, but the S821 isn't remotely a dealbreaker.

Here's the usual rundown of what we discovered about the G6 during our time with it.

You can, of course, download untouched video samples, the way they came out of the LG G6. We've uploaded a bunch of them up on our server: a set of three from the normal camera (2160p, 1080p/30fps, and 1080p/60fps), and a matching trio from the wide-angle one (2160p, 1080p/30fps, and 1080p/60fps).

Anyway, the 4K videos are encoded with a 47Mbps bit rate, 1080p/30fps gets 17Mbps (in either aspect), and 1080p/60fps is treated to 24Mbps. Audio is recorded in stereo at 156Kbps in all video modes.

The video quality in 4K is superb. The captured detail is still among the best on the market (still, it can't top the G5) and there's very little noise. Colors are pleasing too - not over the top, but not dull either, and the G6 also handles changes in exposure well (thanks, weather).

We figure it's a higher-res sensor behind a wide-angle lens, and a center crop of it gives you the 'normal' view, while the wide-angle view uses the full coverage of the lens, but downsamples the higher-res image to 5MP. Although, looking at the photos, it could be a 5MP sensor to begin with, center portion cropped and upsampled for the 'normal' mode.

All of this is to say that selfies aren't spectacular, but are alright. They contain enough detail for their 5MP, and do a fine job of rendering colors.

And the G6 does a good job too. Midtones get a nice boost and a significant portion of the otherwise blown highlights gets salvaged. The effect isn't over the top, but the HDR shot is a little more dramatic. Combine that with a 125° lens and now you have proper drama. With both cameras, however, we're seeing a drop of fine detail in the HDR shots.

There's more than the average amount of noise that we're used to seeing - perhaps that's one area where the small-ish sensor can only do so much. It's no worse than Sony's own Xperias in this respect, not even close, but it's a little more telling where the sensor comes from than other phones.

Colors are vibrant, without being as warm as the G5's - a better struck balance between reality and consumer appeal, if you ask us. If you don't deliberately push it beyond its limits, dynamic range is quite good too, actually.



Grid shot is like a camera booth - it creates a 2x2 photo collage. Again, half the screen is the viewfinder, while the other half is the collage in the making. After you're done capturing the shots, you can choose to re-take one or more if it turns out you made the wrong face.

Match shot is the oddest of the modes, we think. The idea is you take two square shots of objects that have little in common, and align them so that one flows into the other. Well, great, but why? It's also super difficult to get the second shot to line up with the first, and while you do get to pinch-zoom and move the second image around, you can't re-take it, so you need to start over from the first shot.

That's resulted in some changes in coverage too. The normal camera now sees a 71° field of view, as opposed to 75° before, while the ultra-wide angle's FOV has been reduced from 135° to 125° - still very much ultra wide.

The lens on the normal cam still has an f/1.8 aperture and is stabilized, while the f/2.4 lens of the wide-angle cam isn't. The wide camera is fixed focus only, unlike the normal one that does actually use the phase detection agents on the IMX258. Laser autofocus is gone this time around.

The camera app of the G6 has seen some changes as well, to make better use of the tall display. Or, rather, wide display, when you hold it in landscape. The extra screen estate on the side is used as a film strip, showing you recently taken shots. You still get a shortcut to the gallery next to the shutter release button, too. A most welcome addition in the LG camera app is the exposure compensation slider that shows up on the right when you tap somewhere to focus - a handy tool that's been missing so far.

The clarity however was top notch - perfect with no resistance applied to its line-out and excellent with our standard headphones set. The only affected reading was stereo crosstalk and even that didn't suffer too much.

Keep in mind that LG will supply the G6 with a Quad DAC in the South Korean Market so this model might get even better results but we're perfectly happy with what we've got on this one anyway.



The fact is, the app is one of the slickest-looking we've seen. It supports RDS so it will pull the current station's name along with whatever gibberish it's broadcasting. It only does it for the current station and not for the entire list of stations. You can name 6 favorite stations, there's an option to output through the speaker (headphones still needed for reception), and there's a sleep timer as well. No recording though.

The image editor is a very basic one. You get filters, cropping, and rotation, but the image parameters you can alter are limited to Light, Color and Pop.

You can easily bring in more photos on the device - the G6 supports DLNA (so you can view photos stored on computers on your network) and cloud support. It's pleasingly comprehensive - Drive, Box, Dropbox, and OneDrive are supported (with most phones you get just one of those or not even that much).

Concert mode optimizes the mics' response for extremely loud environments, while in Studio mode you can record voice over an audio file (say, a vocal track for your new song) and you can use headphones to monitor the sound.

The quality is top notch - uncompressed WAV and compressed FLAC are available at up to 24-bit and 192kHz. Going to Custom gives you manual control over Gain, Low cut filter (75Hz/150Hz) and Limiter (prevents clipping of low-frequency sounds).

Nougat offers native number blocking and call screening. You can block numbers based on their initial or final digits or just specific numbers. Third-party apps can ask Android which numbers are blocked, so apps that use them to identify users (like WhatsApp and Viber) can also reject calls and messages from those numbers.

"With the announcement of the G6, LG seems to be sending out a very clear statement: the modular smartphone is dead. After the indisputable market failure known as the G5, the Korean giant seems to have completely pulled out of the race to make the idea of a smartphone with interchangeable parts a reality, and is again pursuing the dream of the conventional flagship. From what we've seen so far, that dream has mostly come true: the newly-announced G6 is certainly a capable device, but also one that doesn't completely shy away from trying out new ideas. That mix of the expected and unexpected elevates it above being just another paint-by-numbers smartphone, but still keeps it suitable for the everyday consumer, instead of catering exclusively to enthusiasts.  To prove that, we've decided to do a specs review of the LG G6, which will hopefully give you an idea of what the device will be like in real life. So let's dive right in:
When it comes to looks, LG has certainly gone the conventional route this time: the G6's metal frame sandwiched between the all-glass front and back panels is certainly a flashy exterior, but is nothing we haven't seen before. On the back of the device one can find the dual-camera setup with an LED flash, along with the fingerprint sensor placed slightly below them. LG has once again foregone its tradition of putting the volume buttons on the back of the device, and they are positioned on the phone's left side instead.
The power button, too, hasn't moved, and can be found embedded into the fingerprint scanner. Also worth noting is the fact that the camera setup is completely flush with the back panel, which is completely flat as a result.
The front of the device is almost exclusively dominated by its screen, with minimal screen bezels and no physical buttons present. Above it sit the front camera, sensors, and earpiece, while the space below is empty, save for the LG logo. The bottom edge houses a USB Type-C port and a speaker grille, while the top plays host to a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The G6 comes in one of three different color variations: Mystic White, Astro Black, and Ice Platinum, with the latter featuring a sleek faux brushed metal design. The phone measures 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm, dimensions almost identical to that of last year's Samsung Galaxy S7.   Perhaps the biggest problem of the G6's design is its glass back panel, which can be a dealbreaker for some. Glass is notorious for being both a scratch and fingerprint magnet, which can quickly kill the device's sleek looks. Also, while LG has put considerable effort into minimizing screen cracking, it doesn't appear to have given as much attention to the back panel, which could easily turn out to be prone to breaking, despite being made out of Gorilla Glass 5. While real-life usage is yet to validate such concerns, they're still well worth mentioning.
The newest trend when it comes to flagships is apparently cramming in taller displays, and the G6 is at its forefront. The 18:9 (or 2:1 if you will) IPS LCD panel measures at 5.7"", and features a QuadHD+ (2880 x 1440) resolution. The first thing one notices when looking at it, however, isn't its size or resolution, but rather its curved corners, a feature LG advertises as significantly helping against cracked screens. The front panel also features Gorilla Glass 4, which should further help prevent this problem. While LG promises its UI will take good advantage of the unusual aspect ratio, it remains to be seen how good third-party support will be.  The display supports the Dolby Vision HDR technology, which lets it display up to 64 billion colors, provided you have access to a video in a compatible format. With the G6, LG has opted not to go the curved edge route like its main competitor, the Galaxy S8, claiming such phones are uncomfortable to hold and prone to cracking. Bezels are thankfully very thin, though the effect is slightly diminished by the unusual screen edge design.
In a somewhat controversial move, LG has chosen to equip its newest flagship with Qualcomm's older Snapdragon 821, rather than the upcoming 835, in a bid to gain some market advantage over its main competitor, the Galaxy S8, by means of simply launching earlier. While some argue this was, in fact, a brilliant move, it remains to be seen whether it will have the desired effect. As a result, the device comes equipped with a quad-core processor and 4 GB of RAM, which should be more than enough for most people, but may displease some of the power users out there.
The battery has a 3300 mAh capacity, which should be enough to last a day or so, but is unfortunately non-removable. In a direct jab at Samsung and the Note 7 fiasco, LG also flaunts the extensive testing of the device's battery, claiming it's much more reliable. As part of the Snapdragon 821 chipset comes compatibility with Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 standard, with promises of a 50 percent charge in just 32 minutes. The US version of the device will be the only one with support for wireless charging, courtesy of Qualcomm's WiPower standard, while the previously rumored Quad DAC will be included in only select few markets, which exclude the States and Europe. A cool feature LG borrowed from the Google Pixel is the gesture-enabled fingerprint scanner, which lets users navigate more easily with one hand. The phone is also IP68 certified, meaning it's both dust and water resistant, which is good news for people prone to spilling.
A big problem for some could be the inclusion of only 32 GB of internal storage (64 GB in some Asian countries). While the phone does include an SD card slot, external storage is still a tad slower than built-in one. This problem has been somewhat rectified by the option to format an SD card as internal memory, which was introduced in Android Marshmallow, but it's still a clunky and imperfect solution. While not many people need that much storage, it could still prove problematic for those who do, so keep that in mind.
Another recent trend we've noticed in high-end phones has been the inclusion of dual-camera setups. The G6 isn't LG's first venture into the technology, however: the G5, too had two rear cameras, though the difference here, however, is that rather than use different sensors, the company has chosen to equip the G6 with two identical, 13 MP ones instead, resulting in a wide, 125-degree angle similar to the human field of view. The feature is, thankfully, optional, as some people might not like the somewhat distorted-looking results. The front shooter, too, features a wide-angle lens, measured at 100 degrees, but the sensor is an otherwise unimpressive 5 MP. The rear camera also supports the HDR10 format, letting users take photos with a much larger dynamic range.
The bundled camera app takes advantage of the device's 2:1 screen, offering a number of special shooting modes, called Snap shot, Match shot, Grid shot, and Guide shot. All of them use square photos, but with different results: Snap shot displays the last photo next to the one being taken right now; Match shot stitches two photos, one on top of the other; Grid shot makes a 2x2 square collage; and Guide shot overlaps a portion of an image over the camera preview. 
The G6 reveals a lot about LG's strategy regarding its smartphone business – while its predecessor aimed at radically changing the industry, the company's half-hearted approach to the idea of modularity and the lack of consumer approach ultimately doomed it. The G6, however, strives for subtlety instead – it features no groundbreaking features, but instead presents a familiar-looking phone with a few extra bells and whistles. This, combined with the device's early launch window, show the company is willing to tackle its competitors head-on, rather than try to subvert expectations with unnecessary gimmicks. Whether this tactic will be successful is up to a number of factors, so we'll just have to wait and see.
Smartphones are changing. And not in the sort of standard “slightly faster than last year, and with a marginally better camera” way that ends up defining so many popular handsets. With the fresh crop of 2017 flagships just beginning to land, we're seeing the arrival of a new direction for one of the most familiar, fundamental components of a smartphone's hardware makeup: the display. And while it may not turn your day-to-day interactions with your phone on their head, changes are coming that threaten to tweak the way we hold our phones, operate them (especially one-handed), and consume media.  With the LG G6, the manufacturer invites us into the new world of the 18:9 screen. For years now, the standard 16:9 display has dominated smartphone sales – even Apple (reluctantly) joined the party – but this year we're finally seeing the companies that make our favorite phones start trying something new. And while LG may be the first, all the leaks we've been seeing of upcoming hardware certainly suggest it won't be the last.  LG G6 Review LG G6 Review This new extra-wide (or extra-tall) shape for the G6's screen is a big part of what makes this phone so interesting, but that's far from the only design decision worth paying attention to. We've got a sleek new look with no appreciably camera bump, a premium, glass-encased metal body that trades its removable battery for water-resistance, and built-in wireless charging (for some of you).  Add to that things like a no-compromise, full-resolution wide-angle camera, and Google's latest software and services, and we've got what looks (on paper, at least) like one of the most compelling new smartphones to land so far this year.   Does the LG G6 deliver on all of its potential, or will it follow more in the shoes of the G5 and its modular hardware: a possibly good idea, but one quite thoroughly ruined by some bad decisions about its implementation and marketing? Let's waste no more time before getting deep into what you can expect from one of the year's first big-name flagship phones. 
The LG G series has long been one defined by its design. From the G2 (the first to drop the old “Optimus” branding) through the G4, that meant lots of unusual rear-mounted hardware buttons, including the volume rocker. And even though LG returned to more traditional volume controls for the G5, the rear power button remained – while upgrading to pick up an integrated fingerprint scanner.  But with the LG G6, we're looking at a company that has decided “enough with the past.” Sure, we've still got that rear power button, but to a very large extent, LG has decided to tackle the look and feel of the G6 from the ground up. And as it would happen, that's a very good thing.
We're going to pivot back around to LG's crazy-wide-screen display in just a moment, taking a closer look at what it offers (and why), but it's impossible to talk about the design of the G6 without putting the phone's screen front and center. While this isn't a phone that strives to offer a stunning bezelless or otherwise over-the-edge display, it's still one that's particularly eye-catching if only because of the spectacular job that screen does at filling the phone's face.
LG quotes an 80-percent screen-to-body ratio, and while that's not quite the highest we've ever seen (thanks to entries from companies like Xiaomi), it still goes a very long way towards making it feel like you're not so much holding a phone with a screen on it, but that you're just holding a screen. Little details like how the curves at the corners of the display mirror the curves of the phone itself really help sell that that illusion.   The rest of the G6's body is similarly refined. A solid-feeling metal frame helps you get a good grip on the handset, and while the phone's back looks like brushed metal, as soon as you pick it up you'll realize it's protected by a pane of glass. Yet while the G6 is glass front and back, it's not a model that suffers a lot as a result; the phone still feels surprisingly durable, and resists showing off stray fingerprints – helping to keep it looking as premium as possible.  Speaking of durability, LG blesses the G6 with an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. That's been a long time coming, and while it's hard to get overly excited about when so many other phones do the same thing, it's still fantastic to see LG step up to join the rest of the pack. We used the G6 in conditions ranging from a light drizzle to a heavier downpour, and while the phone showed some of the expected touchscreen glitches when actively covered in water, it also suffered no permanent damage.
LG's flagship phones have played around with screen sizes for years, usually bouncing around the low-to-mid 5-inch space. With the G6, though, we step up to a panel that's solidly in phablet territory – though you might not appreciate that to actually use the phone.  The G6 is built around an all-new 5.7-inch LCD screen with a 2K-class (1440 x 2880) resolution, rounded-off corners, and featuring an extra-wide 18:9 aspect ratio.  We could spend this entire review just talking about the unusual new display LG chose to use on the G6 – what's changed, why that matters, and how it all ultimately impacts how you'll use the phone – but because there's a lot more to this smartphone that just its screen, we're going to try and show some restraint.  First, though, we've got to talk about the shape. This 18:9 aspect is arguably more properly called 2:1 – that is, the screen's exactly twice as tall as it is wide. Your typical 16:9 phone screen, by comparison, is a bit too short to have the same said about it.  This means several things for how you use the phone. If you're watching regular 16:9 video on it, you're going to see some black bars on the sides. And while it's easy to associate such bars with a feeling of “I'm watching this content on the wrong screen,” they can actually work the G6. For one, there's enough wiggle-room such that you don't have to jam 16:9 video right up against those rounded corners, losing some pixels in the process. And the screen's also wide enough that you can call up your virtual on-screen Android buttons without them appearing on top of (and blocking) your video.  The situation with apps is a little tricky, as few are explicitly designed to be used on a screen like this. Thankfully, LG includes an easy-to-use settings panel that lets you dictate how apps are scaled to the screen. And if you don't like how one option looks, it's simple to switch to another. Really, though, we didn't run into many issues with how apps use the screen – though it's very nice to know that LG has gotten ahead of the potential problem, all the same. The main downside is that you can only adjust the scaling for downloaded apps – not pre-installed software (like most of your Google titles).  How about those curved corners? Unlike the way most smartphone screens are perfect rectangles, LG rounds-off the corners of the G6's panel. They're not perfect 90-degree arcs, and we have to admit that our first reaction to seeing them was a bit along the lines of, “eww, why?” We even briefly considered the lengths we might go to with custom-ROM hacking in order to try illuminating those missing corner pixels. 
But then we sat down and talked to LG about what was going on here, and the story began to make more sense. See, this isn't just some weird software trick to give the G6's screen a (more) interesting look. And you can't turn those curved corners back on in software; the screen really is clipped. But it turns out this is about way more than just aesthetics. By avoiding hard right angles, LG is trying to mitigate screen damage caused by drops and other impacts. While the shock wave from such incidents has a bad habit of traveling along the screen, being concentrated in right-angle corners, and causing breakage, this new design supposedly lessens that risk. And though we're not about to go intentionally dropping our G6, the company's own tests with actual hardware seem to support the idea that this change really is making a difference.  While we're quickly finding ourselves won over by the eccentricities of the LG G6's display, it's still not a screen without its issues. Though our measurements confirm that the display is decently bright, it's still a phone that's dimmer than a number of its peers, and our subjective experience often felt like the handset was on the dimmer side when actually using the G6, especially outdoors. Part of that may be attributed to its cooler color temperature – but short of some pre-set blue-light-reduction options for nighttime usage, there's no way to customize that look.   Color reproduction in general also isn't superb, and while it's better than many phones, there's a touch of AMOLED-style (which this LCD panel very much is not) over-saturation at the top of the screen's output range. At least, that's our experience with the UI, but the phone does claim to offer a wide color gamut with its support for HDR video, including both Dolby Vision and HDR 10 formats.
LG's Android interface is one of clean design, powerful customization options, and sensible layout. Running atop Android 7.0 Nougat, the UI never feels heavy or that it's forcing you do something in a way you may not like. Don't dig having all your apps cluttering the home screen? Toggle back on a classic app drawer. Not a fan of having system settings broken up across tabs? You're just two taps away from switching back to the familiar all-in-one list view. LG gives you options upon options, and those efforts go a long way towards making the G6 – a phone that's at high risk of seeming “weird” or just different from every other Android you've ever held – feel more like your own. 
The big questions most users are going to have about the interface aren't these sorts of general Android concerns, though; what's the deal with this new screen shape, and how does it impact usability?  Well, we've touched on some of issues already when covering the display, talking about the phone's software controls for changing app scaling and their aspect ratios in order to keep things functional and natural-looking on the G6's 18:9 screen. That's one big part of the equation, but we also see how existing Android functionality takes full advantage of this new screen geometry. Take multi-window for instance: while split-screen on phones always ran the risk of feeling more than a bit cramped, the shape of the G6's display helps two apps exist side-by-side in just a bit more comfort.  Other apps are specifically designed to tap into all this extra space. We're going to talk about the phone's camera (and its software) in-depth in just a moment, but that's a great example of an app evolving for this new 18:9 world. There, LG finds room to squeeze a camera roll of recently-shot thumbnails up against the side of the screen, while still having more than enough space for camera controls and your live viewfinder. We'd love to see even more apps with such ingenuity (and a sense for making the most of available space), but even this is helping us appreciate that, in the right hands, 18:9 can be more than just a gimmick.  All that said, the screen on this phone is tall, and there's a good chance you won't be able to reach it all at once in one-handed operation. That's made slightly more frustrating by the presence of only very sparse explicitly one-hand-enhancement UI tweaks. Admittedly, the screen isn't so wide as to cause many problems, but the height can be an issue; you may end up shifting the G6 around in your hand as you go from interacting with Android navigation buttons to pulling down your notification shade. 
For 2017 Android flagships, there's one question on everyone's mind: is the phone running the hot new Snapdragon 835? While Sony can say “yes” to that with the Xperia XZ Premium, and all indications point to Samsung going with the chip for the Galaxy S8, LG isn't quite ready to hop on that same train when it comes to its own phones. Instead, the G6 runs the Snapdragon 821, a slightly faster version of the insanely popular Snapdragon 820. It's a very solid chip, but it's also decidedly a 2016 model, and in a market where image matters, and the perception of performance is nearly as critical as raw speed-test figures, that's a decision that could later come to haunt LG.  The company offers legitimate-sounding rationales for its choice of processor, talking about the lengthy development pipeline. And while that's a valid defense, we can't help but wonder just how much more attractive the G6 might be to shoppers if LG had waited to give it the same chip as the rest of this season's top-tier hardware.
Now, in full disclosure, we evaluated some early LG G6 handsets, and while we're looking at what sure appears to be final hardware, further software tweaking could have a pronounced impact on both qualitative and quantitative performance.  Using the phone, everything feels appropriately smooth, whether stretching an app to fill the G6's extra-tall screen, or running a pair of them side-by-side. While that's promising, we can't help but raise an eyebrow to certain benchmark tests that bring in lower framerates than we'd expect from this configuration of hardware. It's possible that some further tweaking may enable LG to squeeze some more performance out of the handset, but we wouldn't go into buying the phone with the expectation that there's going to be a drastic improvement right over the horizon.  LG gives the G6 the expected 4GB of RAM, but we're a little sad to see it stick with just 32GB storage (at least for the US model). While that's going to be good enough for many users, we love the wiggle room we get with 64GB, and that level's already becoming synonymous with really top-shelf, power-user phones – somewhere we're sure the G6 would like to be.   At least there's micro SD expansion, and like the G5, LG's back with another unusual side-by-side tray for the memory card and SIM. That tray's now protected by a prominent gasket, reminding us of the phone's water-resistant upgrades.
There's nothing too surprising about the G6's connectivity options, supporting tri-band LTE-A Carrier Aggregation for its cellular radio, 802.11 a, b, g, n, and ac for Wi-Fi, as well as NFC and Bluetooth 4.2. We're not really sweating the lack of dual-SIM compatibility (though that may matter more to some users). 
As you should be able to tell from that breakdown of G6 camera hardware, LG has made a real commitment to making this phone a serious contender when it comes to smartphone-based photography. And while the images it produces aren't maybe as effortless as those shot with a phone like the Pixel or even an iPhone 7, we're still generally satisfied with what we were able to get out of the G6's cameras.
With as oddly-shaped a screen as the G6 has, potential buyers are bound to start asking, “where can I get some video content that matches the dimensions of my screen?” And while there's a growing list of 18:9 productions available through streaming services, sometimes the best answer really is “just make it yourself.” To that end, in addition to the expected assortment of video recording modes, the G6 also includes a couple 18:9 options.
Maybe the trickiest thing about enjoying media on the G6 – and enjoying it in its fullest – is simply getting access to that content. We just talked about shooting your own 18:9 video, but you've also got streaming options, and if you subscribe to a service like Netflix, you'll find series such as Stranger Things or House of Cards all ready to be viewed full-screen, with no black bars to be found.
Watching video with other apps can be similarly tricky. VLC ended up working quite nicely, letting us scale our video to fit the G6's screen as we chose. You Tube was a bit less successful, and especially when we were dealing with footage already in a wider-than-16:9 ratio, often ended up with a windowboxed result: that is, video with black bars on all four sides around it. Two sides are acceptable. Four mean that you're wasting screen real estate. We're not trying to throw around blame here, but it's still worth pointing out a common use-case where the G6's screen-fitting tools let users down.
When using the G6 as a handset for voice calls, audio quality was very nice, and the phone's extra-tall shape subtly helps improve its ergonomics for such tasks. But while general call-making didn't leave us wanting for any major improvements, we can't say the same for the G6's speakerphone, where audio quality took a bit of a dive. Perhaps this is one of those features that will get better as LG finalizes the phone's software, but for now we'll be leaving the speakerphone off.
The decision to launch the G6 without a removable battery is going to be a controversial one, especially with LG as one of the last hold-outs offering such a feature on its flagship phones. But all is not lost, as while the G6's battery is baked-in, it's also much larger than the 2,800mAh component from the G5, now topping out at a very phablet-level 3,300mAh. 
The LG G6 is a phone that wears its ambition on its sleeve. It's not afraid to say, “to hell with the past; this is the way things are now.” It doesn't look like a G4 or a G5, nor does it feel like one. And while that kind of departure from the status quo can be enormously risky, the vast majority of our interactions with the G6 suggest that it's a move LG was wise to make. 
Putting the G6 up next to other 5.7-inch phones, LG's ability to squeeze that much screen real estate onto this small a handset is nothing short of impressive. That it can go head-to-head with the smaller-screened iPhone 7 Plus and make that sleek, sophisticated handset seem chunky and bloated by comparison is real accomplishment for Android manufacturers.

LG does a lot right with the G6, but it's also not a slam dunk. We can't help but wonder what performance and battery life would look like if LG only had some slightly different priorities going in to making the G6, and there's going to be a not-unexpected period of adjustment as content creators adapt to this new 18:9 era. 

Pricing is another serious concern, with the G6 going for about $650 to just over $700 from the various carriers. While that's very much flagship-level, it's also just a bit cheaper than you'll pay for Samsung's Galaxy S8; then again, Samsung's got some tempting freebies available for pre-ordering customers, like a full Gear VR setup with motion controller.

Right now, the thing most shoppers will be wondering about as they consider picking up a G6 will be how the phone stacks up against the Galaxy S8. Samsung's still recovering from the Note 7 PR nightmare, and we can already see LG turning the screws on Samsung a little in its G6 promotion. For the moment, it's easy for LG to get a few shots in, but if the S8 is half as good as it's looking, that window could be closing soon.

If you want to jump on the G6 now, by all means, go ahead: it's going to be hard to feel let down. But if you're always wondering “what if,” it couldn't hurt to sit things out at least through the end of the month and see if Samsung steps up in the way we're expecting it to.
Maybe the new screen shape won't be nearly as controversial as us hardware nerds make it out to be, and the app and media issues will largely pass users by unnoticed. But even if they're not thinking about pillarboxing or aspect ratios, they're absolutely going to pay attention to the way the G6 feels like the entire thing is one big screen.

Even better, the G6 now supports wireless charging. Well, that's the case in the US, anyway, though LG has foolishly decided that international markets won't appreciate wireless charging in quite the same way, so they'll have to do without. Radio differences between markets – that we get – but varying feature sets are enormously frustrating. First the Quad DAC, now this...

Battery life on the G6 is a bit of a double-edged sword. On one hand, standby times can be really, really good, and if you're not spending a lot of time actually interacting with the G6, you probably won't have a problem picking up the phone at any moment and finding plenty of battery capacity remaining, even several days after a charge.

But actually use the G6 for any appreciable period and you're going to see battery life start dropping – and sometimes, fast. Our tests saw the phone managing just minutes over six hours of screen-on time before running dry. That puts the G6's endurance at an hour or more behind a lot of its flagship competition. It's not necessarily a deal-breaker (like if we were looking at five hours of screen-on time), but there's a real chance that the G6 won't quite have enough juice to address your power-user needs.

With support for Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0, recharge times, at least, weren't bad, and we got the G6 back up to full capacity in a bit over 100 minutes. Between that and the wireless-charging support, it gets a little easier to give the G6 some leeway with its battery-life issues – but still, another hour of raw endurance would go a long way towards making us feel better about the whole situation.


As for sound, the single speaker on the G6's bottom edge is slightly quieter than some of its peers, but still very much capable of the kind of output levels we demand. We found ourselves wishing we could pair this big, beautiful screen with some stereo sound, but sadly LG doesn't use the phone's earpiece as a second speaker. 

Headphone output does a bit better than the internal speaker, but even this isn't without an upset: in some markets, the G6 will get a fancy 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC for its audio output, just like we saw on the V20. Unfortunately, that list doesn't include the US.


At least, that's possible, but getting there can be less than intuitive. Even after firing up Netflix, and identifying and tracking down some 18:9 video, it still wasn't quite filling the screen. It took a moment to hit us: the app has to be manually set for 18:9 mode in the G6's system settings. Once you make that adjustment, everything falls into place nicely.

As we mentioned, the G6 supports both Dolby Vision and HDR 10 high-dynamic-range video standards. We'd love to try some of that action out for ourselves, but Netflix restricts such footage to only its highest-end tier. If you're already on the four-screens plan, though, you should be good to go.

Those cover both HD (1440 x 720) and FHD (2160 x 1080) resolutions, but you do miss out on some fancier extras when filming in 18:9. There's no buttery-smooth 60fps mode, for one, as well as no 18:9 equivalent for 4K UHD shooting. Those concessions aren't too, too bad, and while we absolutely love having 18:9 filming options at all, it would have been nice to get one that can record at the full resolution of the phone's screen.

Video shot with the G6 looks pretty darn good, and the phone did an admirable job at managing exposures, refocusing on new subjects, and capturing intelligible audio even when fighting against some serious wind. One big plus is the ability to toggle between zoom and wide cameras while you're right in the middle of filming, and while there can be a very brief period where the camera has to recompute its exposure levels, it's still impressively seamless. We also really enjoyed the video stabilization mode, helping to remove a bit of the “this was clearly shot on a handheld device” jitters.


A big appeal there is the easy transition between standard and wide-angle shots, and it can be a bit stunning just how pronounced a difference that choice in framing makes.

Shooting with HDR set to auto, we found the G6 not taking advantage of that processing option maybe as much as it should have, but especially when it did, our shots looked great. Without it, there was a little less certainty we'd get the tonal balance we were looking for, but few pics came out really disappointing. 

Night shots also look quite nice, but here in particular we start to notice the differences between the two cameras; with both OIS and a larger aperture, the narrow-angle camera produces noticeably superior low-light photos than those available in wide-angle mode. The selfie cam also supports standard and wide-angle shots, though that's physically just a single wide-angle camera. Unsurprisingly, we preferred the native wide-angle option.

Finally, we have to talk about some of more gimmicky shooting modes LG's cooked up for this weird 18:9 screen. Since that 2:1 ratio means you can have two perfect squares side-by-side, LG's built its camera software to take advantage of that geometry. For instance, you can shoot one square picture and then match it up with another square for some juxtaposition fun, or take a series of four pics that add up to create their own square (with the other half of the screen acting as a viewfinder). There's nothing wrong with any of this, but nor does much of it feel particularly valuable – take it or leave it.


LG was already an early adopter of USB Type-C, and we see the reversible wired interface make an expected return here. Not every connectivity option has returned, though, and while the LG G5 could interact with your home electronics over its infrared link, the G6 lacks such a feature.Dual-camera smartphones are old news by now, and it seems like there's nearly as many different ways to implement such dual-camera systems as there are phones taking advantage of them. Do you merge the data from both sensors? Should they have similar properties, or attempt to each capture unique image information? 

LG has already zeroed-in on the idea of giving its phones camera with very distinct lenses: one standard (or perhaps telephoto, at least by comparison), and one wide-angle. That was the case with the G5, as well as the V20, but with both those cameras, the wide-angle lens was paired with a lower-resolution sensor. For the G6, LG puts its cameras on a closer-to-even playing field, making both of them full 13MP components.

That's not to say that they perform the same, and beyond the obvious field-of-view distinction between the standard and wide-angle cameras, the former gets a wider f/1.8 aperture (letting in more light) and gets to enjoy the presence of optical image stabilization. The wide-angle lens, meanwhile, has an f/2.4 aperture and no OIS. Still, we're just hugely happy to see them come in at the same resolution, and swapping between the two is so fast, it's easy to choose the right camera for any particular shot.

"The beautifully design LG G6 is water-resistant with a tall, expansive display and an extra wide-angle camera.
In high school, being different only works if you're also cool. Otherwise, you get mocked or, possibly worse, completely ignored. LG can no doubt relate.
So does it usurp its biggest South Korean rival, the S8? Not exactly. On paper, the G6 doesn't have as powerful a processor and as long-lasting a battery. LG fans will also be disappointed that said battery is no longer removable (then again, neither is the S8's). And while earlier LG was set to announce its big-screen, small-bezel phone, Samsung's S8 takes the same basic idea and adds more elegance with a unique curved-edge twist.
The G6 is LG's nicest-looking flagship yet, which I don't say often, especially given last year's out-there G5. But the polished G6 has a streamlined aesthetic and a smooth unibody design (think the LG V20 with fewer seams or the G5 with fewer bumps). It's a bit heavy in the hand, but that doesn't bother me much. Like with previous LG handsets, the fingerprint sensor is built into the home button on the back, which sits below the camera (and not next to it, like with the S8). Oh, and don't worry, there's still a headphone jack. 
The phone feels expansive and ""tall,"" especially when you're scrolling down your web browser or social media feed. Not all apps and games take full advantage of this ratio though, and when they can't, you'll see black bars on the sides of the display even at full screen, aka ""pillarboxing."" You can enable ""app scaling"" on some apps by going into Settings. The longer display works, and seeing that you get more screen for about the same build size, I'm all for it.
With that said, waterproofing and removable batteries don't tend to go together these days, so the fact that the G6 does not have a removable battery was kind of a given. Still, to longtime LG fans, this might come as a disappointment. After the LG G2 in 2013, the company has been one of the few holdouts to feature swappable batteries in its flagship phones, so people can switch a drained one for a charged one or replace an old battery with a fresh one.
Like the V20($480.00 at T-Mobile USA) and the G5 before it, the G6 has two cameras on the back. But they aren't to take artsy ""bokeh"" portraits like you do with the iPhone 7 Plus. On the G6, you can switch between the standard 13-megapixel lens and the 120-degree wide-angle lens to capture more content in each frame. If you're really all about that wide-angle life, the 5-megapixel front-facing shooter has a wide-angle option as well.
The app can be confusing at first, and features like Match Shot were hard to figure out initially. But once you get the hang of it, the results look pretty cool. My favorite is Guide, which overlays a framing template so you can capture similarly-composed photos repeatedly.
Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low light. Compared to the Pixel($64.97 at Amazon.com) XL, OnePlus 3T($439.00 at OnePlus) and Galaxy S8, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images though, and I like the rich contrast of the S8 by just a tad. But the G6 captures sharp and vibrant images regardless, and other than blurry selfies in the dark, you'll be satisfied with the camera setup.
The G6 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processing platform, which specs nerds will notice is the same chipset in last year's OnePlus 3T and Google Pixels. Compared to the 821 chipset, Qualcomm's latest 835 is measurably smaller, faster and quicker at recharging mobile batteries.
Tech fans and phone buffs often complain about the lack of smartphone innovation. But when companies experiment with something novel, their efforts often flop or fold. Meanwhile, incremental iterations of familiar handsets like the iPhone 7($699.99 at Amazon Marketplace) and Galaxy S7 remain big hits.

LG took a chance with the G5 and when that became a dud, it switched gears and made the G6 like every other flagship you see now (and will probably keep seeing throughout 2017). That's not exactly a bad thing though. By going with a simple, sleek design, a water-resistant body and a feature-packed camera, LG is giving phone users what they want. Covering the basics may be boring, but it works when you do it right (and even better when you can do it for a cheaper price). In the case of the G6, while it doesn't have anything novel or buzzworthy, it's LG's most marketable and widely-appealing phone yet.

When I benchmarked the 835 in a reference device, it indeed outpaced phones with the 821 (including the G6) by a comfortable margin. And while the S8, which also has the 835 for certain markets, garnered slightly lower scores than the reference device (this makes sense, since reference devices are designed for peak performance), the S8 still consistently edged out the G6.

But take these results with a pinch of salt. Unless you want to be on the absolute edge of technology, the idea of being saddled with ""last year's"" processor shouldn't be a huge deal, and the advantages of the 835 aren't that dramatic on paper. In the real world, the usual differences between one superfast processor and another are hardly discernible. During my time with the G6, it was smooth and fast. Apps launched and quit promptly, the camera operated quickly and the display was responsive.



For more information, check out our video on the G6's camera, the slideshow below and our gallery for outdoor photography with the G6.



One of my favorite things about the camera is a new interface that shows you five of your most recent photos, like a gallery stream. LG added a separate camera app called Square Camera too. Aimed at hardcore Instagram users, it offers a number of different tools to take neat square photos. (For more on how Square Camera works, watch the video below and check out our explainer.)

Not having that advantage is a drag, but it's not a deal-breaker for everyone either. LG also hopes that the G6's increased battery capacity (from 2,800mAh in the G5 to 3,300mAh) and new wireless charging feature -- just for the US -- can offset the benefits of a swappable battery. During our lab tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the handset lasted an average of 13 hours and 21 minutes, which is better than last year's 12.5 hours.

The Galaxy S8($769.00 at Amazon.com) doesn't have a removable battery either. Samsung's flagships ditched that years ago. Its 3,000mAh battery clocked an average of 16 hours of drainage time. Samsung also said the overall life expectancy of the S8's battery life will last longer as well, years down the road.

In addition to its beautifully glossy design and screen, the G6 is dust- and water-resistant like the S8s, the Apple iPhone 7s and several Sony Xperia phones. It's rated IP68, so you can dunk it in up to 4.9 feet of water (about 1.5 meters) for up to 30 minutes. For the everyday user though, it just means the G6 won't crap out after you accidentally drop it in the pool or spill coffee on it. (Get a deeper dive on IP ratings and what they mean for waterproof gadgets.) I dunked it in a fishbowl and a bucket of water and let it sit each time underwater for 30 minutes. I also placed it inside a shower with the water splashing on it for 30 minutes. In all three instances, the handset kept ticking fine afterward, and it even registered an incoming call during the full dunking.

The sharp, 5.7-inch screen takes up roughly 80 percent of the front of the phone, leaving it with an impressively thin bezel all around. It's unique in that it has an 18:9 aspect ratio (with the exception of the S8, most phones are 16:9).

But Samsung's still dealing with some Galaxy Note 7 fiasco fallout, and the G6 is a great alternative if you're squeamish about Samsung. Plus, with a $600-$720 (depending on the carrier) price tag, the G6 is about $30-$100 cheaper than the S8. For the first time in a long time, an LG handset stands a fighting chance to be your next high-end Android phone. It may not be popular enough to be Prom King, but it's a no-compromise premium phone with enough mainstream appeal to be on the ballot.

After the lackluster reception of its unique, modular-like G5, LG decided not to double-down with another quirky approach to mods. Instead, it reversed course, toed the party line and released the more traditional G6. Gone is that funky hot-swappable chin. In its place is a slim, water-resistant build whose screen takes up an enviable 80 percent of the phone face. For LG, this is the safer but smarter play since the G6 has to do battle with the OnePlus 3T, the Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S8.

"he quick take: LG achieves its goal of packing a balanced, powerful Android experience into a more hand-friendly form factor. But it remains to be seen whether the G6 is a true ""flagship"" to compete with the upcoming Galaxy S8. The LG G6's success (or otherwise) will depend on its price tag, and how the competition measures up.
For the past several launch cycles, it seemed like LG needed to have some eye-catching new thing to attract attention to its phones — a single crutch which would, hopefully, make consumers care about its G-series handsets over Samsung's dominant Galaxy range. Recent efforts have included shiny shiny crystals, notification tones from singing schoolboys, lasers!, cow parts glued to the back and bad modular accessories.
Sure, we can make fun of the LG Rolling Bot and the Vienna boys' choir, but the ideas weren't universally awful. The real problem was that LG, in the past three years, seemingly hadn't progressed much further than the old metaphor of throwing shit at a wall. Some of it has stuck — features like dual cameras, OIS, laser autofocus and super-sharp displays have become staples of the modern Android flagship. Others, like buttons on the back, haven't made the cut.
And it's no surprise that in 2017 we're adding the LG G5's ill-conceived modular system to that conceptual dumpster.
At first glance, the LG G6 is both familiar and something of an oddball. For a 5.7-inch phone, it's smaller than you'd expect. There's an entirely obvious reason for that — for a modern smartphone of any kind, the screen is a good deal taller than any previous model. And while the curved glass back panel has echoes of Samsung's Galaxy line, the front is almost aggressively flat, with a chamfered metal trim that's essentially flush with the display.
The G6 is crafted from metal and glass, and now the battery is fully sealed in, so you won't be popping off the back to swap power packs — or, for any other reason. As a result, this thing feels solid and well-built, with clean lines, precise joins and a pleasing contrast between the deliberately flat front face and the more ergonomic curved rear. This isn't a rugged phone by any means, but it feels much more sturdy than anything LG has produced before. Your three color options are black, white and ""platinum"" — my personal favorite — the back of which has a neat brushed texture beneath the glass.
The solid outer frame holding everything together has a pleasant brushed texture, and the chamfers on either side help with gripability. These side walls aren't as intentionally slim as many of Samsung's recent phones — the G6 wears its 7.9mm thickness on its sleeve. But again, there's something reassuring about a phone which doesn't try to chase numbers like this.
While the G6 may feel like a well-built, premium smartphone, it's worth pointing out that like every other device with a flush glass back, the rear of this thing is inevitably going to accumulate scratches. I've already picked up one particularly gnarly one right in the center of my G6's back panel after just a few days of use. (At least it has no trouble staying still while laying on a flat surface, unlike, say, the notoriously slippery Honor 8.
And on the inside, there's a dependable assortment of high-end, early-2017 specs. At its core, the G6 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 (not the upcoming 835, which won't be around for another couple of months), backed up by 4GB of RAM. The base model, somewhat disappointingly, only comes with 32GB of storage, though that's offset by the microSD slot, to which heavier content can be offloaded. (System data, in case you were wondering, takes up a whopping 11GB on my U.S. unlocked G6.)
Some of the G6's other tentpole features have weird geographic restrictions. The Quad DAC — an upgraded version of the audio feature from the V20 — is only available in Korea and a handful of other Asian markets. And wireless charging is exclusive to the U.S., so other regions will have to make do with good old-fashioned cable charging over Qualcomm Quick Charge 3. And if you want a 64 GB G6, that's also restricted to parts of Asia and Eastern Europe.
For everyone else, it's 32GB, no Quad DAC and no wireless charging, which seems unnecessarily stingy given that few other manufacturers split up features like this. (It also means there's no single G6 model with all these features.)
The speaker setup is more run-of-the-mill. There's a single, bottom-firing can that'll get reasonably loud, but without the bass and clarity of rivals like the iPhone, HTC 10 and Huawei Mate 9. It's decent, but nothing to write home about.
It's easy to look at the software on the LG G6 G6 next to an V20 (or even a year-old G5) and say that not a whole lot has changed. And you wouldn't be entirely wrong in saying that. The color palette, rounded rectangular icon style and lack-of-an-app-drawer by default have held over from the previous generation. However the fact that LG hasn't completely scrapped its software design and started over is a good thing. Instead of a completely different visual style, LG has cleaned things up across the board, to produce a UI that looks like an evolution of last year's software efforts.
The new 2:1 display lets LG crank up the information density and introduce some interesting new software features to take advantage of its lanky proportions. That taller display lets LG split many of its own apps — like Contacts, Music and Calendar — into two (mostly) equal square sections, with rich visuals up top and extra room for information down below. And obviously a taller screen is great for multi-window too, allowing you to see more of each individual app.
Other LG staples like KnockOn (double-tap to wake) are back, and extra-useful because the power key and fingerprint sensor live around the back. However if you were hoping LG would mimic the Pixel's swipe-down shortcut on the fingerprint scanner for quick notification shade access, you'll be disappointed — the gesture isn't enabled on the G6. That's a shame, because this kind of gesture shortcut would be amazingly useful on such a tall device, where reaching the top of the screen can be challenging. You can at least conjure up a notification shortcut button in the nav bar down below.
The LG G6 also has the honor of being the first non-Google phone to ship with Google Assistant, the same Google-powered AI that first arrived on the Pixel to mixed feedback. Assistant on the Pixel is useful, but not quite the killer app Google has promised, though it has been improving significantly in the four months or so since launch. There isn't anything particularly special about the G6's implementation of Assistant, it looks and works exactly like it does on Google's handsets, allowing you to ask questions directly to Google, and receive spoken answers back based on the knowledge graph, and the information in your Google account.
As on the Pixel, there are instances where Assistant can startle you with its wisdom — like correctly identifying a building based on your description. Other features, like the ability to recognize songs (something built into the regular Google app on Android), are oddly still not there.
The G6's dual camera setup is sure to be one of the more controversial hardware decisions, because on paper it seems like the phone takes a small but noteworthy downgrade (or at best a sidegrade) compared to its immediate predecessor.
On paper the G6's main sensor doesn't appear to be anything special. Yet the overall package, with that bright lens and OIS, beats the Galaxy S7 and goes toe-to-toe with the Google Pixel in the dark, thanks in part to LG's software tuning. And although wide angle camera can become grainy in darker conditions, it's miles ahead of the old 8-megapixel sensor from the V20 and G5. With a steady hand (and sometimes, the assistance of LG's great manual shooting modes), it's possible to get some fantastic wide-angle shots.
I was ready to be underwhelmed by the G6's cameras, just based on the numbers, and instead I've been very pleasantly surprised. This is a fantastic camera setup, with fine detail performance to rival some of the best out there, great dynamic range and punchy, but not unnatural colors. It's also been great to get reacquainted with the 125-degree wide-angle camera — a feature I loved in the G5, but soon had to leave behind because the rest of that phone was so disappointing. It's true that the difference in optics reduces fine detail capture in wide-angle shots, but still, being able to just push a button and capture a really wide field of vision is incredibly fun.
Around the front, there's a 5-megapixel, 100-degree sensor that can switch between a cropped-in view and a wider angle to fit in your friends, a bit of extra scenery, or both. Low-light performance on the front-facer isn't great, especially in video mode, but it's perfectly fine for sharing on your phone, via Facebook or whatever else. And as you'd expect, performance improved rapidly with decent indoor lighting, or in daylit shots.
The G6's rear shooters make for a much more capable video camera, with software stabilization features that you may remember from the V20. As usual, the regular camera does a bit better in the dark compared to the wide-angle. And at a normal walking pace, LG's stabilization does a good job of smoothing stuff out, with only minimal ghosting in tougher lighting conditions. I'd still say the Google Pixel's video stabilization is better overall, but it is pretty close, with the biggest difference being more noticeable blurring around lighter areas within darker shots.
The move away from removable batteries gives LG the chance to fit a slightly beefier cell in its new high-end offering. And that's exactly what it's done, with an ample (but not numerically outstanding) 3,300mAh internal battery keeping the G6 chugging along. And you'll be able to rapidly juice it up using Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0, just like the G5.
I've found the integrated power pack to be good for a solid day's use out here in Barcelona, even over the course of a few busy days getting ready for Mobile World Congress 2017. Bouncing between LTE and Wifi, and taking a couple of hundred photos each day, I found I'd take the G6 off its charger at around 8am and start running out of juice again around 10pm. That said, making extensive use of the cameras can quickly drain the G6 into the danger zone. On a couple of heavier days when I was taking lots of video as well as still images, I hit the 15 percent warning level by 6pm in the evening.
When I look back on many of the gimmicks LG has tried to use to sell smartphones over the years, the most striking thing about the G6 is how this time the focus is on just making a good, balanced phone that does most thing really well, and a few things. As much as you could argue that the taller display is indeed a gimmick, LG's doing enough with it that it's not just there for the sake of it.
Most importantly, the core experience of the G6 is flagship-class across the board, with a good-looking design, top-notch display, solid performance and battery life — and that's complemented by a surprisingly great camera setup with some really fun features. The G6 isn't exactly cutting edge in every area — LG tells me it deliberately isn't playing the spec game this time.

Even so, its success is going to depend on its price tag, especially when you consider the Galaxy S8 is just a couple of months away. And should it be priced within striking distance of the Samsung flagship, it may be a hard sell for LG.

Regardless, right now, the G6 is a solid phone that I can absolutely recommend. The Korean firm hasn't achieved perfection here. Instead, it's a return to form.

Welcome back, LG.



That's pretty much standard for a high-end Android phone right now — a full day's use, but probably not much more than that, and extra power suck from using demanding features. Naturally, should you need a mid-day refresh, Qualcomm Quick Charge 3 has you covered.

Since we've been using the LG G6 with pre-production firmware, we'll update this review when we're on final G6 firmware to note any differences, as well as any changes — good or bad — in battery performance over time.



Americans also get wireless charging support to boast about, a feature sadly exclusive to the United States. Given that Samsung has been offering wireless charging as standard for almost two years, it seems crazy for LG to limit this functionality to specific regions.

3,300mAh isn't an enormous amount of juice for a 5.7-inch phone, but the G6 manages just fine regardless.

As with still photography, the most fun aspect of shooting video with the G6 is seeing just how much detail you can suck in with the wide-angle lens, giving you a more immersive view into the subject of your footage.

On the software side, LG has also expanded its camera app to take advantage of the new 2:1 aspect ratio, with a useful filmstrip view giving showing you your last few photos alongside the viewfinder. Some shooting modes have been rearranged too, with the HDR toggle (confusingly) now living behind a menu overflow. Instead, LG gives top-level exposure to panoramas, 360 pano and slow-mo modes.

Once again, photography might be the main reason to choose an LG phone this year. However good the Galaxy S8's camera is, it's basically guaranteed to lack the G6's wide-angle chops. And the fact that it outperforms expectations in darker shots bodes well for its competitiveness against what's coming later in the year.

Some of my fellow Mobile Nations editors have been eyeing the G6's wide-angle camera with envy, and I suspect for many phone buyers in the coming months this feature might be what sells them on the G6.

It's also important to note that low-light performance from the G6 — at least from its main sensor — far outperforms what I had expected based on the specs. I think the Google Pixel still captures slightly better color detail, but when it comes fine detail performance, the advantage is LG's.

And in daylight, the results can be truly spectacular, with rich colors complementing the broad field of view.

Whereas the G5 has a 16-megapixel main camera backed up by an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens, the G6 has two 13-megapixel shooters — one wide-angle camera at 125 degrees, with an f/2.4 lens, the other an f/1.8 lens, optically stabilized, at a more traditional 71 degrees. For what it's worth, we're not talking about any kind of fancy 1.4 or 1.5-micron pixel sensors, like Google's Pixel and Samsung's GS7. You've got plain old 1.12-micron pixels at play, which usually wouldn't bode well for low light performance.

So there's parity in terms of megapixel count between both cameras, but because of the disparity in optics, you'd expect the wide angle camera to come out a little worse in low light performance.

So how does real-world performance measure up?

All in all, I'm pleased with the software tweaks LG has made here, though Android purists may view it as a little too customized.

It's just unfortunate that few third-party applications are likely to take advantage of the new, taller screen in the same way LG's own apps do. (That may change when more devices adopt this taller aspect ratio.) And obviously an 18:9 screen will leave you with unsightly black bars on the sides when you're watching standard 16:9 videos, giving you a significantly smaller viewable area than the 16:9 diagonal of the physical display.

Meanwhile, the rounded corners of the screen, while they're a neat design touch, annoyingly don't quite match up with the corners of the bezel — it's a minor thing, but something you can never un-see. (Your screenshots, for what it's worth, have plain old squared-off corners.)

LG's flirtation with ""squircles"" — rounded rectangular bubbles for each of its app icons — continues in its latest software, giving both first-party and third-party apps a rectangular border for added visual consistency. Although if you're not a fan, these can be easily changed in the home screen settings panel.

The rest of the software builds on the work LG started last year with the G5 and V20, making things a bit more visually consistent throughout, and settling on a refreshed design language with lighter colors, plenty of rounded rectangles and geometric graphics that fit with Google's Material Design language. LG's color scheme is vivid, but not obnoxious, and the company has taken a leaf out of Google's book with wallpapers based upon layers of colored card, and abstract graphics in apps like Weather and Clock.

The company has also built out a range of themes to complement each of the G6's colors, with icons and wallpapers to match the outer hues of each model. Some of these look pretty jarring, however, so I've stuck to the default theme on my device.

LG's latest interface is built upon Android 7.0 Nougat — unfortunately not the newer 7.1.1 Nougat right this second, but LG tells us the G6 will indeed launch on 7.1 in when it comes to the U.S. (In Korea, you'll get the 7.0-based firmware we've been using for the past few days.)

LG's dual camera system returns, this time with 13-megapixel sensors in both rear shooters — the 71-degree standard camera and the 125-degree wide-angle. Around the back, you get both standard and wide-angle shooters at 13 megapixels, this time using the same sensor. There are some differences in terms of the optics though. The standard camera has a bright f/1.8 lens and optical stabilization, on the wide angle it's f/2.4 without OIS. So, predictably, the wide-angle camera doesn't perform quite as well in low light. We'll dig deeper on this in later in our review.

A lot of fuss has been made about the fact that the G6 is technically launching with last year's processor, and that it's stepping down from 13 megapixels in its main camera. Yet while it remains to be seen how the G6 will measure up next to the wave of new phones expected to arrive in the months ahead, I'm largely OK with the hardware on offer here, both on the inside and the outside.

A phone's display is always one of the most important hardware characteristics, and that's especially true of the G6's extra-tall screen. It's a 5.7-inch IPS LCD at 2880x1440 resolution (think Quad HD with an extra 300 pixels or so stacked on the top), and it looks great. After all the well-documented issues with the G5's disappointingly, dark, weirdly green panel, it's fantastic to see this return to form in the G6. LG claims the panel can reach over 600 nits in brightness to stay clearly visible under sunlight, and that matches my experience using the phone for a few sunny days out in Barcelona.

The display is also Dolby Vision and HDR 10-ready, and LG told us the phone would ""just work"" when HDR content starts to hit the mobile versions of streaming platforms like Netflix. We don't have any specifics on exactly how that'll work, though.



Other hardware staples include IP68-rated water and dust resistance, meaning you don't need to worry about your G6 getting drenched out in a rainstorm, or rinsing it off if it ends up on the wrong end of a spilled beverage.

(In meetings in Seoul, Korea ahead of today's launch, LG hinted that more G6 colors would likely be arriving sometime after launch.)

That's a deliberate design decision, LG tells us, with the idea being to avoid exposed ""2.5D"" glass protrusions on the front, which would be a structural weakness should the phone take a tumble. (You'll still need to deal with curved glass on the back, however that panel is furnished in Gorilla Glass 5, as opposed to version 3 of the material, which makes up the screen.) The front face has an unconventional look, but it's also a welcome respite from the sea of phones with slightly curved glass displays.

This is a phone which feels both big and small at the same time, and the form factor is just a tad reminiscent of traditional candybars like LG's own Chocolate phones of yesteryear. Of course there is an argument to be had about just how useful a 5.7-inch, 18:9 display is, given that most videos, shot at 16:9, conjure up black borders on the G6. But for the most part, Android apps fill the extra space without issue.

Perhaps the G6's 18:9 2:1-aspect ratio screen is just this year's LG thing, to be discarded in another 12 months or so in favor of the next thing. But after a few days of using the phone ahead of its MWC 2017 unveiling, I'd argue that it's more than mere gimmickry. There's a solid, if slightly understated phone built around this lanky display, and LG's attitude with its latest handset is less ""look at this crazy thing we did"" and more ""look at our cool new phone.""

At the same time, the company isn't targeting spec hounds with 2017's G-series phone, which isn't an enormous leap beyond the V20 in raw horsepower, and actually lacks a couple of that phone's major features. (All part of an effort to better differentiate the G and V lines, LG tells me.) I'd hope to see that reflected in the eventual price point, which I don't yet know at the time of writing.

Anyway, is this new, gimmick-free LG phone actually any good? It's time to find out.
