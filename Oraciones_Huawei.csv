One might think it's a coincidence the first two or three times but when you display the notification menu you slide your finger up and down it repeats a pattern I always end up staining just the front camera Without being expert in terminal design I would say it has to do with That the top edge of the screen is too close to the front camera that maybe being slightly higher or to one side would have prevented this annoying pattern,"['display', 'camera', 'screen', 'camera']"
Anyway nothing that can not be solved with a cloth always near or with a protective layer with the possible loss of sensitivity in the associated screen,['screen']
It is a step forward that has to give the high range but not everyone will appreciate will not be a strong argument of sale and that increases the consumption of battery although its autonomy will comment on a separate point,['battery']
The only but respect to the screen is that seeing the tendency of other manufacturers to rush the frames LG G6 S8 those of this P10 Plus become too big and it seems that the screen is not all taken advantage of as it could have been,"['screen', 'screen']"
However the screen is bigger than the one of the P10 a 16 specifically and the resolution also,['screen']
Taking into account also those 6 GB of RAM it is logical to be a phone to which you want to take advantage with many applications at the same time games multimedia content etc,['ram']
One of the days that I squeezed the battery most I arrived at 3h and 35 minutes of screen and were passed the 1 of the dawn,"['battery', 'screen']"
For many applications that you humanly have open to use you will always move with a margin of RAM of between 2 and 3 gigs,['ram']
To this day there is no way to take as many gigas of RAM in a mobile phone,['ram']
That yes that everything runs smoothly here the Kirin 960 shows once again the success of Huawei with its own technology will not have any kind of delay or lag even frequent applications like the camera will stand in the background so that taking a picture is a lot Faster when you need it and those 128 GB of storage will give you great pleasure to install or download things without braking but there is nothing to justify right now those 6 GB of RAM,"['camera', 'storage', 'ram']"
I think that here Huawei has room for improvement to continue debugging the efficiency of its components rather than offering RAM because it does,['ram']
The problem is that it is not excellent in any of the aspects and the price of the unit that we tested 6 GB of RAM 128 GB of storage is 799 euros,"['ram', 'storage']"
Taking into account its disadvantages you are convinced to have RAM and storage to spare two very good cameras oriented to more artistic ends and a battery to be quiet every day Then maybe this P10 Plus is for you,"['ram', 'storage', 'battery']"
Design and screen of the Huawei P10 the expected jump Let's start with what draws most attention to the past course the change in its design in its visual language,['screen']
That coupled with a side curve that starts from the back and practically reaches the screen makes us have a really pleasant feeling in the hands,['screen']
But what may not convince at all seeing what has presented LG Xiaomi or what is expected to present Samsung and Apple is its design in terms of screen,['screen']
Do not misunderstand me the quality of the screen with 5 1 inch IPS NEO panel with better blacks than ever to be an IPS panel and with FHD resolution is still the best,['screen']
But I want to complain and although it is true that the price of this Huawei does not reach the level of LG and company expected something more risky in the design of the screen,['screen']
Huawei has been conservative perhaps too much and although overall it is a design 10 product on the screen you can start to take this strategy bill,['screen']
Camera and sensor Huawei fingerprints become great Those who take time following Huawei know that was one of the first to incorporate fingerprint sensor in the back but either by feedback from users or because by design there was no other have decided Incorporate it now in the front and at least occupy a space that would otherwise be unusable and somewhat difficult to assume in 2017,['camera']
2 not only serves as a fingerprint sensor but in the settings menu we can configure to use it as a capacitive button thus hiding the navigation bar and providing more the screen,['screen']
My experience At first I liked being able to save that space on the screen with lateral gestures for multiventana and different pulsations to go back or go home but after a few days of use I think I still have to polish the sensitivity and I lose things like double touch on button Recent apps to go to the last app,['screen']
In photographic section was the protagonist of his presentation of new betting by double camera,['camera']
Here I do not want to expand too much because you have a complete article that we have published a few days ago where you can see the results in depth with all detail so just say that it is a really complete camera that needs to be polished at the software level in both being more Intuitive for the user as to the level that the portrait modes work perfectly without any blur problems where there should not be any,['camera']
Performance of the Huawei P10 binomial software hardware and battery And how is the experience using this mobile in the day to day Here combine two parts on one side your hardware with the same processor as the Mate 9 created by Huawei own the Kirin 960 attached to 4GB RAM and 32GB expandable internal memory,"['battery', 'processor', 'ram', 'memory']"
0 Nougat with its own layer EMUI in the latest version you already know an iOS style but now allowing more fluid application box smarter to close apps and tasks that are not necessary and save battery and with a very strong bet by trying to get the most Autonomy of our device,['battery']
I have arrived at 4 hours of screen without problems which depending on the use can be to spend of the day but in my case with a mixture of WhatsApp telegram twitter pocket and around 20 minutes of game it has been complicated to me not to have to load it,['screen']
 Like its immediate predecessor  the P10 series offers a similar hardware package across two screen sizes  contained in a classy  understated metal shell,['screen']
  Elsewhere  there are plenty of design holdovers from last year s P series phones  including the glass camera window up top  which sits flush with the surface of the metal,['camera']
 Then there s the screen,['screen']
  White balance is adjustable in the display settings menu  for what it s worth,['display']
  Huawei includes a factory fitted screen protector in the P10 as standard  just like most of its other phones,['screen']
 However unlike the P9 and Mate 9   and even cheaper models like the Nova   neither P10 has an oleophobic coating on the screen,['screen']
  That s the smudge resistant layer included as standard in the vast majority of phones  without which the display quickly becomes smudgy and greasy,['display']
 And for your own sanity  please keep the factory fitted screen protector attached if you plan on picking up a P10,['screen']
 Both P10s are based on the same Kirin 960 platform as the Mate 9  meaning there s plenty of performance to go around  whether it s paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage in the smaller P10  or 6GB 128GB in the Plus,"['ram', 'storage']"
 After the rebirth of EMUI on the Mate 9  Huawei didn t need to do a whole lot to translate that experience onto a smaller screen  and so the new EMIU 5,['screen']
 Android s notification center is mostly unmolested  save for Huawei s customized quick settings implementation and a separate permissions system for lock screen notifications  which can be a bit confusing,['screen']
 Huawei has partnered with GoPro to include the camera maker s Quik application on the P10  giving you an easy way to conjure up highlight reels with transitions and music matched to your photos,['camera']
  Like the Mate 9 Pro  the P10 lets you use gestures on the front mounted fingerprint scanner to replace the standard on screen buttons,['screen']
 It s a decent idea in theory  but I never fully wrapped my head around this new button dynamic  and retreated to the safety on screen keys pretty quickly,['screen']
  So there are no massive changes from EMUI 5 to speak of  and the overall experience  in terms of both visuals and performance  boils down to that of using the Mate 9 s software on a smaller display,['display']
1       While the P10 Plus comes with display  DPI  scaling options  letting you see more on screen at once  this isn t enabled on the regular P10,"['display', 'screen']"
 We re a year into Huawei and Leica s strategic partnership  which has yielded some dramatically improved camera performance  and there are some big changes in the P10 s imaging setup  in both the hardware and software,['camera']
 Huawei s camera app and Kirin ISP pair up to re light your subject s face on the fly  smooth out blemishes and artistically defocus the background,['camera']
 Many of the same features also work with the P10 s 8 megapixel selfie camera   the front facer is now Leica certified as well  and situated behind a bright f 1,['camera']
 On paper  the optics of the second gen Leica camera setup in the smaller P10 haven t changed at all since the Mate 9,['camera']
  The big camera hardware upgrade has been reserved for the P10 Plus  which introduces dual f 1,['camera']
 Firstly  in high contrast scenes with lots of brighter and shaded areas  Huawei s camera struggles to retain color detail  with some areas of certain shots being rendered in black and white  even in full color mode,['camera']
 Between relatively large battery capacities  homegrown processors and tight software controls for background apps  Huawei phones have always punched above their weight in terms of battery life,"['battery', 'battery']"
  With the P10  you re getting an ample 3 200mAh cell  which is a little above average for a phone of this size  with some extra power savings coming from the use of a 1080p display,['display']
 With those kind of usage patterns  I was looking at around five hours of screen on time per charge,['screen']
 Again  that s a step below the Mate 9  but in a phone with a smaller battery and a higher screen resolution,"['battery', 'screen']"
  Combining the ability to complete a meaningful recharge in around 30 minutes with great battery life in general  the Huawei P10 emerges as an excellent performer,['battery']
 The P10 forces me to choose between two bad options  leave the screen protector on and deal with a display that feels like crappy plastic  or take it off and live in a frustrating hellscape of screen smudges,"['screen', 'display', 'screen']"
  At the risk of stating the obvious  the display is the primary input and output device on a phone,['display']
 It s pretty clear this phone is supposed to be used with its pre fitted screen protector attached,['screen']
 You ll get a good looking device with great performance and a fantastic camera,['camera']
 Were it not for my reservations over the screen  the P10 would certainly qualify as one of the best Android phones out there,['screen']
 And the P10 Plus comes with that extra bit of icing on the cake   a brighter lens for some amazing low light captures  and the option to spec it out with oodles of RAM and storage,"['ram', 'storage']"
 It sits just below the screen  although despite it looking like the home key on a Samsung device you can t press this down  as it s not a button,['screen']
 You can also swipe to the right to open the previous apps screen,['screen']
   ust be warned  you ll likely spend your first few days getting frustrated  as you ve tapped the button to go to your home screen but instead find yourself returning to a web page,['screen']
  As with its other phones Huawei is putting a big focus on the camera for the P10,['camera']
 There s a dual camera setup on the rear of the P10   that s a 20MP monochrome sensor working in tandem with a 12MP color shooter,['camera']
 We ve found that in good lighting the P10 s camera is better than the P9 s  but it s not doing anything remarkably different,['camera']
  There s also a new Leica branded Portrait mode  which improves facial tracking and includes a beautification mode   we ll tell you more about this in the upcoming camera section,['camera']
  Huawei has opted for a Full HD display on the P10  unlike competition from LG and Samsung that have QHD panels,['display']
 The screen is much the same as we saw on the Huawei P9  which we were mostly pretty happy with,['screen']
  You ll be able to reach all corners of the display without stretching out your fingers,['display']
 We also found the display to be super bright  which is great if you re often using your phone in strong sunlight,['display']
1 inch Full HD display is great for watching movies and videos  and the phone s size means it s easy to hold while viewing  although you may want a slightly bigger screen if you re going to be watching a lot of video   the P10 Plus and its 5,"['display', 'screen']"
5 inch QHD resolution display may suit you better,['display']
  The Huawei P10 comes with 64GB of storage onboard  and supports microSD cards up to 256GB if you need more than that,['storage']
  There s a powerful processor and a lot of RAM behind the P10 that will mean gaming performance keeps pace with other recent flagship devices,"['processor', 'ram']"
  There s a powerful processor and a lot of RAM behind the P10 that will mean gaming performance keeps pace with other recent flagship devices,"['processor', 'ram']"
 Huawei has included its own HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset inside the Huawei P10  the same processor we saw in the Huawei Mate 9,['processor']
  Here it s paired with 4GB of RAM  and this combo will easily run all the latest apps and games you ll want to be using,['ram']
 Battery life on the Huawei P10 has been improved compared to various older Huawei devices  but it s still not great,['battery']
 That said  we were pushing the P10 hard  and if you re a lighter user you ll probably be okay until you put the phone on charge overnight An hour long commute  listening to audio over Bluetooth and doing a spot of web browsing now and then brought the battery down by 15 ,['battery']
  The Huawei P10 has pretty impressive idle battery life  mind you   we just found that it struggled when we put it through hard processing tasks  or left the screen on for extended periods,"['battery', 'screen']"
