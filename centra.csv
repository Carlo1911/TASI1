         Nougat goodness is coming to the Xperia XZ. After rolling out Nougat to the Xperia X Performance yesterday, Sony is now making the update available on the Xperia XZ. The update brings build number 39.2.A.0.327, and is rolling out initially to the unlocked variant (F8331) as well as the dual-SIM model (F8332).  As noted by Xperia Blog, the Nougat update should be making its way to other Xperia XZ variants shortly. The update itself brings multi-window mode, improvements to Stamina battery-saver mode, enhancements to the camera, and more. In which regions is the update available? Hoping to get one soon Good on Sony. They seem to be improving both their hardware and their software rollouts! Hope the Asus will release Nougat to ZenFones this year XD or better in Q1 of next year I just got Nougat last night on my Moto Z Force Droid!  I've been wanting multi-window support for Android since I lost app windowing when I moved from Windows Mobile (not to be confused with Windows Phone).  It works great so far even with apps that it warns me the feature may not work with.",Android 7.0 Nougat is now making its way to the Xperia XZ

         The smallest phone gets the biggest discount. Update: The Xperia XZ is now a bit cheaper than when we first posted this deal, dropping to $499; that deal is also available in all colors. Original story: Everyone is getting together for a day of deals, which is to be expected after several other days of deals. Sony's Cyber Monday offerings have launched, and if you're looking at an[Xperia phone as your next there are a couple of compelling offers available. Here's what Sony has to offer! Sony's phones have earned a bit of praise this year for delivering decent cameras and the great battery capacity that used to be considered standard. The Xperia X Compact, which is by far the best deal available on Sony's Cyber Monday deals, is a much more reasonably priced option at this lowered cost. Despite the 720p display and lack of a fingerprint sensor, Sony's phones have a history of both quality performance and a unique setup for unlocking and rooting if you're interested in a more technical adventure. You can check out any of the links above to order immediately, or head to Amazon and see all of Sony's offerings! See at Amazon The X Compact is excellent in the hand! It's been $399 for several weeks Yeah, at least, and it actually dropped to $350 thru this weekend - in all colors but the blue. I think that's a fair price, $400 is merely ok for those desperate for a small phone, anything more is just overpriced for a phone with that SoC and missing key features like a fingerprint reader. Would love to love this phone, but it's a dud -- still overpriced, even at $100 off. No fingerprint sensor is a dealbreaker for me. Also concerning is the poor battery life (way below what they achieved with the Z3 Compact), and the poor camera performance (especially in low light). It's mind-boggling to me that Sony makes such great sensors, yet their phones take such lackluster pictures. $299 would be an appropriate price for this phone, and $100 off of that would be a great bargain. I'm curious: what did you do before fingerprint sensors? You do know Big Brother can force you to use your fingerprint sensor for access, versus a password, right? For me, a fingerprint sensor is actually a disadvantage, since it's a feature that takes up room and I'd never use it. I'm fine with the 8 character passwords I use. Generally speaking, before fingerprint scanners, I (like most people) just didn't use any passcode at all. Even a 4-digit code takes too long to type in when you have to do it several hundred times a day. Now that fingerprint scanners exist, I can use password long enough to keep out big brother and snooping kids alike, but I only have to enter it after a reboot (or 24 hours). If you're worried about your fingerprint being used by the authorities, just reboot your phone when you see the flashing lights in the rearview mirror or when you hear the knock on your door and then your fingerprint can't be used against you. It's a fair compromise. $350 at B&amp;H right now.. fyi Nicee They have dropped the prices for the XZ by another $100.00, to $499.99 in all three colors. Getting closer to where it should have been to begin with. Honor 8 for $223 is the deal of the year. If it was $223 it is now out of stock lol. I just went to amazon to look as i had just bought it for $260 day before and was sad haha My bad $229 on Jet. You overpaid lol Oh well.  Only $30 it is now actually like $330 on Amazon haha. But uh at least on Amazon I know if I don't like phone after  2 weeks they will let me return it. Did jet have the blue one that cheap some places were charging more for blue Enter code EXTRA20 That's $229 with tax, tags and transfer fees.","Sony's Xperia X Compact is $100 off, Xperia XZ $150 off for Cyber Monday!

         Bafflingly, the U.S. models' biggest feature gap seems to be a software limitation. For the past year, high-end Sony phones sold in the United States, in the Xperia Z5 and X series, have lacked the fingerprint scanner tech found in their international cousins — a major feature omission for a modern high-end phone. The same applies to the recently launched Xperia XZ and X Compact — fingerprint internationally, no fingerprint in the U.S. Now it appears that the U.S. models' fingerprint sensors may merely be disabled in hardware. XperiaBlog has discovered that flashing UK firmware to a U.S. Xperia XZ results in a fully functional fingerprint sensor. The relatively simple flashing process is detailed over on XDA. With the UK firmware flashed, the fingerprint scanner works just like it would on an international Xperia XZ or X Compact. The revelation only makes the lack of a functional fingerprint sensor in U.S. models appear more strange. Android Central put the question of the missing fingerprint sensor to senior Sony representatives at the IFA tradeshow in Germany this August, but the company wasn't able to give a clear answer on why the U.S. models lacked such a key feature. One possibility is that Sony didn't want to pay the licensing costs attached to fingerprint technology, and so chose to ship the same hardware as the global version, but disable the feature in software. Another is that some outstanding agreement with the U.S. carriers — back when Sony was selling to Verizon and T-Mobile — may not allow it to. We've reached out to Sony U.S. for comment on today's news, and we'll update this story with any response. MORE: Sony Xperia XZ review It has always been that way. The hardware is there, but it's disabled in software. Yeah, it has to just be a patent issue that is more of a problem in NA than in the rest of the world. Nobody has one.lol I wish Sony got their act together though. The Z3 was great. I just got mine today in silver(xz) .  Beautiful. . I need to out my z5 premium for sale now. .
There is Sony fans out there.  Lol. Eh, voiding the warranty is pointless, I get it but I don't. Might as well get the other version. Been like this for years now is anyone surprised? Not sure about using the Xperifirm flashtool.  Where do those ROMs come from?  How do you know that they haven't been modified?  I'd rather use Sony's Emma tool and get the firmware directly from Sony.  The NOBA variant has been flawless and it activated the fingerprint sensor on my Z5C I've had the international version of the Z5 Premium for 8 months now.  I love this phone compared to my wife's Samsung, for me it was worth the warranty risk to have this phone, i love the fingerprint sensor. Sony is missing an opportunity here in the states.  I would definitely get another Sony but understand why without carrier support and hassle free sensor that it's a hard sell in the US. It's a shame it's a beautiful phone. Of course, if you gave 450€ or 730€ for the X Compact or the XZ respectively, you might want to flash a brain into your head first... If they didn't use your money to do so then what's the problem? I don't appreciate people who are careless and brainless with money.
 Specially because those present a higher chance of later defaulting and then it's my taxes the State will use to bail them out. lol Cryptography import/export issue?

         Ten CPU cores in a phone? MediaTek says yes. It's time to kick the week off. We're eight days out from Google's October 4 event, and the hype train is in full swing. We're expecting to see the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, a 4K Chromecast, and so much more. Samsung is facing a three-day delay in restarting Note 7 sales in Korea. The company is trying to complete the recall process in its home market even as reports emerge of ""overheating"" issues in replacement Note 7s. Meanwhile, Lenovo is making the Moto Mods development kit available in China, Europe, and South America. The company is all set to launch the Moto Z series in India on October 4. It looks like the Xperia XZ and X Performance will receive the update to Android 7.0 Nougat in October, with the likes of the Xperia Z5 picking up the update in December. Here's what's making the rounds today. 
<!--*/

<!--*/

/*-->*/

/*-->*/
 According to Reuters, Samsung says the delay will enable it to speed up the return of remaining potentially faulty Note 7s. Sony's latest tiny phone packs its latest 23-megapixel camera, but it'll set you back a fairly hefty $499. Check out our review to see how it shapes up. More MediaTek has officially unveiled the Helio X30 in China. The SoC is one of first to be built on TSMC's 10nm FinFET+ manufacturing process. It offers ten CPU cores — two 2.8GHz Cortex A73 cores, four 2.4GHz Cortex A53 cores, and four 2.0GHz Cortex A35 cores — and can handle 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM at 1866MHz. MediaTek is moving back to Imagination Technologies with the PowerVR Series7XT GPU. Expect to see the Helio X30 SoC in consumer devices next year. Xiaomi is all set to unveil the Mi 5S on September 27, and ahead of the official unveil CEO Lei Jun has shared a camera sample. The phone will feature a dual camera setup at the back, and is rumored to feature a Snapdragon 821 SoC. We'll know more tomorrow. Lenovo has sent out invites for the launch of the Moto Z series in India. We'll see the Moto Z make its debut in the country, and the affordable Moto Z Play is also expected to launch. We'll bring you all the details from the launch event. After rolling out the Moto Mods dev kit in the U.S., Lenovo is now making the Moto Mods Development Kit available in China, Europe, and South America. The kit allows devs to create new modules for the Moto Z, Moto Z Force, and the Moto Z Play. The dev kit will be making its way to Canada on October 5. A leaked slide from Sony Slovakia (obtained by Xperia Blog) shows the Xperia XZ and X Performance receiving the Nougat update in October. Xperia X and X Compact are expected to get the update in November, followed by the Xperia Z5, Z3+ and Z4 Tablet in December. In a rather vague report, the WSJ quotes a broadcast by Korean TV network YTN, which says owners of some ""new"" (post-recall) Note 7s in the country are experiencing ""overheating or losing battery power even as they are being charged."" It's not clear what's meant by ""overheating"" — as we all know, phones can get pretty hot while being used and charged simultaneously. A Samsung spokesman said on Friday that the issue is ""completely unrelated to batteries,"" calling the incidents ""isolated cases"" related to mass production issues. I hope the Nougat update for Z5 improves the battery life and fixes the Bluetooth audio issues. Still on April security patch and this MM update hasn't been very good. Also can't purchase anything in google play store, app crashes every time.
Might be time for a factory reset. I have zero issues with my Z5 . I wish. ""MediaTek Helio X30 has more cores than your laptop"" Huh? The MediaTek X20 had 10 cores also. Several Chinese phones used the X20, so did the Acer 6 Predator ""gaming smartphone"" (that will never, ever receive an update ever.)  And the X20 was updated to the X25, so this X30 is just another iteration of an 18 month old base SOC. As only 2 of the 10 cores reach 2.8 GHz, the only real story is the 10 nm process. Samsung's Exynos 8895 with Mali-G71 GPU and 4 cores running at 4 GHz and 4 running at 2.7 GHz and ALSO using a 10 nm process is a much bigger story. As the Qualcomm 821 only operates at 2.4 GHz on its fastest 4 cores, unless the 830 is able to make a substantial performance boost, the Galaxy S8 will use Qualcomm SOCs just as the Galaxy S6 did. Your last sentence didn't make sense to me, but you're not wrong. The big deal is definitely the 10nm process. Although the title was fine, the x20 and x25 were decacore, but they weren't in laptops, so the statement stands! That should have been ""the Galaxy S8 will use Exynos SOCs just as the Galaxy S6 did"". Yes, ""the x20 and x25 were decacore, but they weren't in laptops, so the statement stands"". That is true. But unless you are one if the 1% of the population that has a performance or gaming laptop, you are running a quad core CPU. Meanwhile Samsung had an octacore Exynos SOC for one of their variants of the Galaxy Note 4 in 2014. Ah, that makes sense. We'll have to see, but I'm sure Qualcomm will stay more or less comparable to the new exynos SoC. Yeah, I actually agree that the core count vs a laptop was a weird point to pick out, I was just being pedantic :p 10 cores.... Am I the only one who prefers a quad-core with powerful cores? No, but I understand the rudiments of how multi threading works and that most mobile applications just won't take advantage of all those cores anyway. I was going to agree with you ... until I ran across this fellow: http://ark.intel.com/products/94456/Intel-Core-i7-6950X-Processor-Extrem... 10 cores. 20 threads. 3 GHz average, 4 GHz maximum.  So apparently there is merit to it ... just not when your 2 fastest cores are at 2.7 GHz. CPUs with huge core counts definitely can be worthwhile if the software you're running can take advantage of all the threads... But as I said above, multi threading just isn't prevalent enough in mobile applications to make it worthwhile. You may already know this, but that i7 is not even remotely comparable to the Helios x30, and is totally irrelevant to this conversation. Also I want it. Yeah, on a desktop, there is a purpose for it. On a phone, though, not too sure. That one isn't as good as you think. While it is definitely a beast of a CPU, if the programs you use or the games you play have poor support for multiple threads/cores than the performance can suffer due to the low clockspeeds. Some games (can't remember which ones) run at significantly higher FPS on the i7 6700K which has 4 hyperthreaded cores at 4-4.2 Ghz. Ultimately it all depends on the application or game and it's support for multiple cores. However, with DX12 (for Windows) and Vulkan (for like every platform) coming into prevalence with drastically improved multi core support, CPUs with heaps of threads will eventually out perform the cheaper options (like the 6700K). TL;DR, a ton of cores only helps when the program/game/application makes use of them (not as common as you might think). I wonder if many Indians care that the Moto Z is coming to India, given they've had access to phones that are at least as good for half a year? Also pretty sure the ""overheating"" of the new notes is probably (completely justified) leftover paranoia from the old explodey versions. At least I really hope it is. Even the relatively cheaper Moto Xs were not well received in India. The Moto Z will be a flop here but it doesn't matter since the Moto G4 and G4 Plus are selling like hot cakes.
I love(d) Moto X and had the first gen and currently using the X Style. I suspect the ""overheating"" is subjective, and may be the result of paranoia as well. Most phones heat up in the right situations... even my lame iPhone gets hot when navigating. Finally Sony's stepping up their software game (thanks to the help of a lot of beta developers) but they should've pushed updates out at this speed since 2014. LOL, its funny how we are just seeing smartphone CPU manufacturers like Qualcomm and Mediatek talking about making their CPUs more powerful and more power efficient, yet, the Snapdragon 820 uses around 4W just like the Snapdragon 801 so there really hasn't been a major improvement in battery life. This is highly evident in a comparison with the Sony Xperia X Performance and Sony Xperia Z3. Honestly, if the Snapdragon 801 was shrunk down to 14nm with changes to the Krait core to improve speed and efficiency, maybe if they made it hexa core, and clocked it at 3.0 GHz, we could have CPUs in smartphones that use 50% less power on the same load as say a Sony Xperia Z3. The Z3 is still one of the best phones out there when it comes to battery life and is not slouch in performance. If smartphone manufacturers put bigger emphasis on battery life more than speed now, that would be much better. Having a CPU like the one in the Z3 but cutting its power consumption down by 75% by shrinking it to 14nm would make insane battery life at the cost of not having performance like the latest Snapdragon or Exynos processors but I don't care about a slightly faster phone more than battery life. Yea but its mediatek so they can release 20 cores and still lag behind. The X series is not bad. The one thing I hate about Mediatek is slow/non-existent software support. They release the latest Android's version support drivers (or whatever) too late or never for some of their processors.","Morning brief: MediaTek debuts 10-core Helio X30, and Xperia XZ may get Nougat in Oct."

          Monday, Sep 12, 2016 at 8:00 am EDT
         Quickly after the disappointing Xperia X series, the Xperia XZ gives a glimmer of positivity for the future. Just a couple of months ago, I received a Sony Xperia X Performance for review. It was the first Sony phone I've used in well over a year, and I was excited to give it a try. Just a few days in, I was pained to write about it — it was a frustrating experience I hadn't endured in years. Our own Daniel Bader wrote a great review that encapsulated my thoughts perfectly. Sony's decisions throughout the phone didn't make sense, and the price made it irresponsible to justify. Only a few months later, we have the new Sony Xperia XZ. It is legitimately a great phone — a flagship that outdoes Sony's phones that aren't even six months old — despite still having a couple head-scratching issues. And though that situation is annoying in myriad ways, the reality is that Sony has made something that actually has me excited about its phones again.  Hey, it turns out Sony can make a good phone! I've been using the Xperia XZ for roughly a week since I received it at IFA in Berlin, and unlike the Xperia X Performance it hasn't urged me to throw it into the ocean. Going a step further, it's even quite nice to use. The coated metal body is sleek and understated, and in typical Sony fashion is perfectly manufactured. It's a little slippery and a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but that's something I can look past — the important part, the feel of the phone, is on point here. And even though it's a bit blockier and larger than the Galaxy S7 I appreciate the design elements that help it stand out from other phones out there. Sony still has its unique design sense. It also seems to be pretty tough — while writing this I dropped the XZ from chest height onto a solid wood chair, continuing down onto a concrete floor, and it looked no worse for it. The Xperia XZ feels like any other flagship Android out there ... with a couple odd changes When you're using it, the Xperia XZ feels like any other flagship Android out there. Performance is good and the software is quick and relatively unencumbered by manufacturer customizations. You still get a good number of useless bloatware apps, but interface-wise there's nothing extra to configure here if you're happy with a basic Android experience like I am. Longevity is just average from the 2900 mAh battery inside, but I made it through a typical day with a little to spare — though Stamina Mode helped near the end of some heavier days. The display is also really good; I don't care that it's ""just"" 1080p. It also has water resistance, USB-C, Quick Charge 3.0 and stereo speakers (though they're a bit on the quiet side). Perhaps most importantly of all, Sony actually finally did something substantial with its camera setup. Yes, we're still looking at a 23MP sensor that we've seen before, but it has brand new five-axis stabilization that seriously improves low-light performance. Indeed, the camera takes much better photos in low light, and daylight photos are quite good — whether you shoot in full 23MP or downsampled 8MP (by default). The important thing to note here is that the camera isn't a weakness anymore — it's good, even though it's just a couple steps short of ""great."" The real issue left in the camera is speed and in some ways software. It's just slower to open and capture each photo than the competition. The ""Superior Auto"" is more like just ""auto"" nowadays, as it really doesn't seem to do anything great — perfect example being that you have to switch into ""Manual"" mode just to get HDR. But, at least the end product is there. Bringing it back to earth a bit, there are still a few puzzling things about the Xperia XZ. Chief among them is the lack of a fingerprint sensor in the U.S. There is just no way to justify selling a phone of this stature without one, and you can't explain it away. Phones as inexpensive as the Moto G4 Plus and Honor 5X have great one-touch fingerprint sensors — and heck, the Xperia XZ has it in other markets. Give it to us in the U.S., Sony. Don't keep doing this. Then you have little annoyances like the NFC antenna being located on the (completely nonstandard) front of the phone, thanks to the metal back, making Android Pay a little awkward to use. And the seemingly random decision to put the volume rocker in a super unfriendly place low on the right side of the phone. A handful of little things that are just curious decisions — you'd love to be a fly on the wall in those design meetings.  It's a good sign that the worst parts of the Xperia XZ are some of the ""easy"" (in the grand scheme of building a complex smartphone) things to fix. A little better battery life, a fingerprint sensor, more attractive pricing — these things don't require landslide changes to the phone or design process. They're a few key points and features that, if improved, will let potential buyers stop focusing on the small issues that turn into deal breakers and instead actually consider buying a Sony phone again. If Sony can pull together a few small remaining parts of its smartphone experience, and combine them with its recent propensity to sell phones direct to consumers unlocked through various popular retailers, all of the components are here for a mini resurgence in the U.S. The hard parts are done — now it's time to bring the whole thing together with a few small tweaks, and Sony will start to win back some mind share, if not market share. Hi ! I'm using Xperia XZ. 3-4 days ago the upper part of the touch screen stopped working. I just want to know if i'm not the only person who's facing this problem. I think you're the only one, an issue like this is very rare. I've sold tons these phones lately. My shop has it for $688 which is a hot deal. I'm a Kyocera fan but this phone is smoother than Kirk Cameron for sure. The camera can blow away any cam on Android. Samsung move over. Nice, do you own a store or online shop? You should put the XZ Silver and Blue as demos at the front if you own a store, it will help you sell a lot. The design of the silver especially looks so beautiful to me. This just in: SlashGear points out that the XZ actually has the hardware for the fingerprint scanner for US-bound phones, but it's been disabled. Again, Sony seems to be handicapping its Xperia line in the US: Zero carrier availability; phones released months after they're available in the EU and Asia (and that's the phones that ARE available; many are not released Stateside); and key tech like fingerprint scanner disabled. To be fair, Sony doesn't get behind any of its products. But in this case, it almost seems like Sony is trying to fail. I had a Z5P for 3 months until it died. I wanted that phone so bad that I ordered it off Amazon, but no warranty. Idk how a global company like that couldn't help me just because my phone wasn't from the USA. I paid 600 and now have a paperweight. So it's hard for me to trust Sony again after my ordeal. I need them to bring their best to the USA with ALL features so I don't look like a fool again supporting them just to get stiffed. I really loved my Z3 before my Z5P. Sony don't mess this up Just 3 months? Aw man. Seattle has a monorail? COOL! See, my problem with the XZ at this point isn't the phone itself. It's Sony.
For every little glimpse of hope the XZ gave us back, the X Mini (NOT Compact) too it away.
This tells me that Sony hasn't learned anything at all. And the mess that is the PS4 ""Pro"" just made it even worse. Hirai and friends have clearly lost the plot. At this point it's not only Sony Mobile that needs new leadership. It's the entire Sony Corporation. Wait until you use this phone and you won't be saying that. The Moto Z / Moto Z Play blows this away. That's with Verizon isn't it? Eh... I must say that I don't think so. Moto Z is lacking in many areas. Moto x pure maybe but not Z. How can you have hope for Sony when they sell their flagship with 1 GB of RAM less than the others, with camera that lacks OIS (that 5-axis gimmick has nothing to do with optical image stabilization, especially 5-axis OIS found in expensive cameras), with smaller battery than the others, without fingerprint sensor like the others? Where's the logic here? And the price? -Of course, like the others.
Having hope for Sony must be a joke, which is pity because I generally do like their devices. It's absurd also that their camera software is always subpar. My xperia z3 can take great photos but only if I tweak the settings for each pic. Having 1GB less of RAM isn't a disadvantage when RAM management is better than most other phones out there with 4 or 6 GB of RAM. The reason why is because it uses a DRAM + Flash integrated module that offers excellent power savings, however in 2017, anything under 4GB will be unacceptable. It does not lack OIS, the 5-axis stabilization is OIS and the most advanced OIS system available in any flagship smartphone and proves it's point by beating out the S7/Note 7 in all stabilization tests. The fingerprint sensor issue can easily be bypassed if you just buy the phone online from another country. However, Sony needs to get that fixed ASAP because it is unacceptable for 2016. The price isn't that bad though at $600 (compared to Z5 $750 at release) though $450-500 would be a lot more competitive. As far as the sources I checked say there's no OIS in this Xperia phone, It is a software thing (co-operating with phone's gyro) and works only in video mode. So it's nothing compared to real OIS like S7/Edge or HTC 10 or to what other phones with OIS offer.
Sony says it is enabled also on front-facing camera which is quite a confirmation of the words above because the FF module surely isn't OIS-enabled. In official phone specs you'll find nothing about OIS, they only say about that magical 5-axis stabilization, but in order to make it optical it  should have actuators in the camera module. That kind of IS might work well in video mode, I'm not saying it's not. That's incorrect, there is something called sensor shift stabilization so there is an actual gyroscope in the camera that accounts for small movements, it was found in the Z5 also. I don't know if you can particularly call that OIS but it functions like OIS. If you really think the S7's stabilization is better, in all video tests, it wobbles a lot more than the XZ so basically having OIS on the S7 is useless. Here's the video (XZ at 4:20 and S7 at 4:25): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjg_ctLUK1E Samsung's OIS stands no chance against the XZ's stabilization. Has Sony given a reason or explanation as to why they don't want to give there US market a fingerprint scanner? It's been discussed several times on here. No one really knows because they haven't disclosed why. Assumption is that someone in the US has a patent for the way Sony implements it and wants big $$$ for it and they're not willing to pay for it. Three things Sony needs to do to make some headway in the U.S. 1. Enable the fingerprint scanner. 2. Lower the price. 3. Partner with all four major carriers. There are other ""nice to have"" features that would sweeten the deal, but without the three I've listed, anything they release will be effectively DOA. Pokegate: 07/14/16 - Never Forget... Easy things to fix? It was easy 4 gens ago. I think it's been basically proven Sony doesn't listen to its customers Sony only listens to the subtle sound of green.... I believe I am going to get the Sony Xperia XZ. Even thought I have a Apple IPHONE 6S. I do like the Android Marshmallow OS too. I rather purchase Sony Xperia XZ over SamSung S7, because of three things. First, I do not have to have lots of features, Second, the battery is more reliable and last longer. And Finally, the camera on Sony performance is great.  Again, SamSung should be doing further testing on their battery before launching. Or another SamSung battery explosion will definitely happen again. URL: http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/...

Probably won't be buying anymore Sony phones if they lose support after 2 years even if their specs are still making par. What's your point? All other phones lose support after 2 years,  The S5 didn't get Marshmallow but be thankful the Xperia Z2 which launched at the same time as the S7 recieved Marshmallow. The reason why Nougat is not being launched on older phones with chipsets older than Snapdragon 810 is due to Vulkan not being supported by older Snapdragon 800/801/805 chipsets. This is why the Galaxy S5, LG G3, and older Moto X phones won't be getting the Nougat update either. Sony actually supports updates for their phones longer than most other companies. But there ARE S5's running Marshmallow officially. Granted, the rollout is painfully slow, but Marshmallow is indeed available on the S5, so they're on par with Z2, I dunno about how it'll run it though. Sony has had some great phones over the past five years that never make it to the US market or arrive far after other vendors products of similar or better features.  Count on this one falling into either of these categories. How Sony consistently makes Xperia a flop against Galaxy and iPhone and let's throw in Oneplus for good measure, is beyond me. I want this phone to be good, but I have to expect that it will be straight up BAD compared to Galaxy and iPhone and even Oneplus, in the little things that add up massively. I don't really need 2K Quad HD, my Xperia Z2 ran faster in places than the LG G4 that had a Quad HD panel and a significantly better processor, and both are already on Marshmallow, so no problems there. But the camera performance has ALWAYS been beyond disappointing for the promises and hardware it brings, they fall flat against Galaxy, iPhone, and even Oneplus. Why should I expect different from this, when all the initial impressions boil down to ""It's good, but...?"" Do bear in mind that the Courts can LEGALLY FORCE YOU TO UNLOCK A PHONE WITH A FINGERPRINT SENSOR should you have a run-in with the law, but patterns and PINS can't, though it is unfortunate. This is beyond me, because every other Sony product IS really as good as if not significantly better than their competitors - PS4 vs XBOX One, Bravia VS Samsung and Vizio, Action Cam vs GoPro, Alpha DSLR and MILC VS Nikon and Canon, it's just... dumb and sad that Xperia falls flat compared to Galaxy, iPhone, and even Oneplus... I assume Sony can get up to the competition with SamSung now, after the exploding battery incident. And I believe Sony has a huge advantage in the games industry already. Including their electronics too. SamSung product testing got cheaper And SamSung overpriced their phones at $1,100+ and Sony Xperia is only at $700USD. Not bad for the price (Sony), in fact it is also running on Android OS platform. I believe Sony have the advantage in the market now. People are actually trying it and they do enjoy it from the market research statistics that are showing in US and UK.  SamSung can set your vehicle on fire:
http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/709098/Samsung-Ga...  Samsung is recalling 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones over exploding battery fears
http://www.sciencealert.com/samsung-is-recalling-2-5-million-galaxy-note... Some truth in that, meanwhile Samsung recalls more phones that were sold in aprox two weeks, on one model, then what Sony sells all year.   Just, saying. That's a huge gap in sales that Sony can capture. They should've made an Xperia X Premium to appeal to those large 5.5""+ screen size lovers. It would steal a ton of Note 7 sales. But ask the average Joe and Jane what brand they think of when I say Android most and it is almost certainly Samsung Galaxy. Besides, if it isn't a Galaxy, they'd just get an iPhone, which is sad. You have to ACTUALLY want an Xperia to get an Xperia, and in arguably the most important smartphone market in the world, almost no one cares about Xperia... Wish the compact had the same internals.
Also, since Sony used to be a go to music player (and loves them bezels!) how come they don't care to put some DAC in their flagship phones? Every single time Sony seems to ruin it by making them priced too high. If you resell your phones, I guess it's good though since Sony phones usually hold their value. It's a good-looking phone and also seems to be capable. But at that price, launching a phone without a fingerprint sensor is absurd. Hey, Sony, fingerprint scanner, stupid. Will this phone have remote play? That is a big thing for me. I tried looking it up and found nothing. Definitely. Not going to consider buying without fingerprint sensor..Do we know why they don't include it in the US? Very strange they continue doing this when it's become standard and essential feature in every smartphone. Just order it online like me lol.  I don't buy phones on bullshiit contracts from carriers and phones come unlocked online when you purchase them. Another advantage of ordering online is the ability to buy the dual edition which has twice as much storage at 64GB. They need to come out with a wow type of phone like a Samsung edge 7 but there own style. They don't have success in the  US and keep pimping out the same shape and style. I was once a huge Sony product fan, but decades of lack of innovation and them chasing everyone else, has led to a company that is no longer the giant they once were. I hope they can right the ship, but it appears they are slowly but surely sinking. Looking forward to seeing this.  Since the Compact is underpowered and not waterproof I'll have to look at the XZ. If the Pixel is waterproof I'll be very interested in it. It's not true that Superior Auto mode doesn't have HDR. HDR is automatically enabled in that mode. I have the int'l Sony Xperia X Performance, and I'm sure the same goes on the XZ too. Of course, it's auto so it theoretically chooses the right mode for the scene, including HDR. The problem is there's nothing particularly ""superior"" about this auto mode — it never switches to HDR, even in the most obvious scenes that need it. Most modern phones handle this situation much better: give an HDR toggle, leave it in ""auto HDR"" by default and let you quickly enable full HDR any time — don't make me switch to ""manual"" mode to get it. Hmm ok. I didn't know it wasn't switching to HDR as often as it's supposed to. My pics always come out great, but I don't know how to tell if HDR was utilized or not by my X Performance when I take pics. I agree that they should let you turn it on while using Superior Auto.  So do you feel Manual Mode takes considerably better pics or is it really close than SA? Nice article. I would totally buy one if i felt my current phone was inadequate but this Z3 still has me going. As for fingerprint scanner just buy international. I do not understand why you guys are reviewing the X as horrible. Besides it maybe being priced $50- $100 too high, why you guys knock it so hard? Has a higher ppi than this phone also. PPI doesn't hold **** in the phone world anymore. Virtually every phone above $100 will have a 300+ PPI display, which will be good enough for 99% of the population. The Xperia X is being knocked against because it's a device with so much potential, yet Sony completely screwed it up so hard. The 650 overheats and throttles in the X, and records 1080p video for 6 minutes MAX before it kicks you out (it can't even record 4K). The camera has such good specs: 23MP sensor that's incredibly high quality, but Sony ruins it by skipping OIS and being so arrogant in its AF: it will actually override your focus point. The battery life is below-average at best. Fingerprint scanner doesn't work in the US. Design is plain. At $300 or 350 with a more efficient cooling system, these other compromises would be acceptable. At $550, within $100 of the Galaxy S7, HTC 10 and the iPhone, these are completely unacceptable. Same goes for the XP: the throttling is better on the 820, but still only does 10 mins max of 1080p (also can't do 4K). Other compromises remain. It also has no special features or claim to fame. At $500, as a name-brand alternative to the OnePlus 3 or Axon 7, the other compromises would once again be OK. At $700, nope. Well for one the X Performance's touchscreen just didn't work properly. Kinda ruins the whole thing. True that would ruin a phone, point taken. But Is it just the performance X with touch screen issues? If so, then the $486 price on Amazon of the regular X doesn't looks pretty good for what you get. $449 would be ideal though. Also I just reviewed your 7 points of the X and I think 6 of your 7 are mostly positive. I really want to root for Sony but I just can't. They make good phones but they handicap them by making stupid decisions like no fingerprint scanner for the US and ridiculously over pricing their phones. Just two months ago the the X-Performance (easily $350-$400 phone based on comparible phones with the same specs) was priced at $700 bucks until the XZ dropped. Sony just like Apple Thinks they can continue to make average phones with below market standard specifications but instead of a good operating system like IOS, Sony continues to hang its hat on a super camera system that can't be optimized to its full potential because of under whelming software.  This next line is going to sound really superficial but I think it holds truth. If Sony had only just matched its competitors by uping the specifications on their phones to 4GB RAM (instead of 3GB), Quad HD screen (vice 1080p) and 3000mah battery (instead of 2900) like everyone wanted then there would be more interest in Xperia phones.  By the way most competitors have managed to produce phones with most of or all of these specifications at lower prices. ... Which is funny and sad, because EVERY OTHER SONY PRODUCT IS SUPERIOR TO THEIR COMPETITORS, especially at the prices they sell for- their Bravia TV's have better detail and functionality than comparable Samsungs and Vizios, their Action Cam line is the only truly viable GoPro competitor, and the PS4 is still the champion of current-gen gaming. Why Xperia is basically a flop to Sony's crowning product range is beyond rationality, the same way justifying voting for Donald Trump is beyond rationality. Sony doesn't promote its stuff. Bravia TVs, Action Cams, Digital Paper, one-piece Walkman headsets, Xperia Tablets. That marketing push has to start from the top, but CEO Kaz Hirai doesn't do anything. He's incompetent, yet somehow all the media people praise him, like Forbes did recently. Doesn't make any sense. Marketing is even more important with phones since you gotta put your phones on carriers, which takes negotiations and co-branding and advertising, and Sony doesn't do any of that. The competition is heavier in phones as opposed to, say, action cameras, so not having good marketing and carrier availability really hurts Sony. Bottom line: they just need a new CEO who is at least competent, who knows you gotta get your phones on carriers no matter what. I'm not saying Sony phones don't have flaws--they do, sometimes many. It's just that their less than 1% share in the Americas has more to do with no marketing or distribution, which is a problem for all of their products. Don't forget Sony's Cameras, Headphones, Walkmans etc everything is top notch they just need to convince the public why their stuff is more expensive. Sony has always been known to use premium components in their products thats why they always cost alot Cough cough ahemmmm cough .... cough cough cough.... it's cough cough allergies cough.... Handicapping is the right word, it's almost like Sony wants to place their phones at a clear disadvantage (the other one is pricing them much higher than other companies' phones with the same specs. It's not like Sony can't produce their phones at scale, and cheaply--they have their own factories in China. But it's almost like they don't want their phones to do well in the Americas for some reason. So they have never tried to get their phones on most carriers, unlike smaller makes like Casio or HTC. Sure, Sony phones do have their flaws (what phone doesn't) but when you're starting from: no carrier availability, inflated prices, and not including must-have tech like fingerprint sensors which every other flagship (and some budget phones) now has, you can't expect people to even look at your phones much less buy them Looks nice.  Now that Motorola phones are no longer really something I would consider it is nice to have another option. I shall reserve judgement until the reviews with production software are out. Primarily to see if they improve the camera any. I love be in Asia,  so fingerprint scanner is a non issue. ""Chief among them is the lack of a fingerprint sensor in the U.S."" To me this makes this phone a non starter in the USA. Virtually every phone costing from $200 and up have fingerprint scanners, but a $700 sony flagship doesn't? That's just plain stupid. Just keep in mind that in the US, having your phone lockable by fingerprint means the court can LEGALLY COMPEL YOU TO UNLOCK THAT PHONE and you cannot contest that in the Courts, but a purely digital lock and encryption by PIN and password cannot be force unlocked without going through the Courts. Read more here. http://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/why-biometrics-are-bad-for-your-constit... So from a privacy standpoint, having a fingerprint lock is WORSE than a purely digital lock. Assuming anyone here would ever end up in court for anything that serious but yeah. Yup, pretty well understood by this point. And that's in no way an argument for not having a fingerprint sensor available on modern Sony phones in the U.S. (nor is it one that Sony is making). You  also don't have to use a fingerprint scanner just because your phone has one. My point is for those of us not expected to be arrested, a scanner is a convenient way to secure your device and is a standard feature on virtually every phone sold in the USA. The cops can look at my phone all they want and look stupid not finding anything, but always entering my pin is a pain in the butt. When you are in a hurry and want to use Android pay, that fingerprint reader comes in handy especially when you are trying to one hand your phone because you have stuff in the other hand Posted via the Android Central App I'm currently a Z3 owner and have been hoping for an  upgrade to go to. The Z5 was not an option and none of the X series did anything for me. This on the other hand has me wanting one. I like the blue colour the most. I just looked at the pricing from one source so far here in the UK for a SIM free phone (not sure if it's unlocked) and it's £499.99 which is not bad at all. It also comes with a a set of Sony bluetooth headphones when you pre-order. Before I buy it though I want to see what it's like in person. So far the reviews are mostly positive. I think some people make too much of about the boring design rather than how good it works in real life. To me that's what's important. I don't see the design being that boring and it looks sleek and stylish. Which is what I want. I remember you from the Z3 pictures thread back when I owned and contributed to the thread. You always had great pictures. Sony is at least taking a step forward with the camera software with full manual controls built in including shutter speed and manual focus controls. I've gone the way of LG as the lack of manual controls on the Z3 and Sony's unwillingness to include them left me wanting more. And boy did I get it with the V10 and looking forward to the V20 soon. But this is probably a great one for you. I'm still taking pictures but haven't been posting them in the thread. I post mostly on Instagram - traveladdict71 If the camera is fixed on the XZ then I would be very keen on getting it as it has pretty much all I want in a smartphone. Cool. Where can you pre-order the XZ for £500? I've only found it on Amazon and Clove for £549+, without said headphones. EDIT: Nevermind, found it! Anyone in the UK interested here's the site - http://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.... looks like Nokia L730/735... The thing about those easy to fix things... Sony has shown basically no signs that they plan to fix them. They've had sub 3000mah batteries in their phones since the Z4. This is the 3rd generation of phones with a fingerprint scanner that doesn't work in the US. Their prices have gotten worse in recent releases. Their camera software has always been sub-par. Their OS/security updates have gotten worse. I'm glad this phone is being received more positively, and has shown an uptick in quality over the X line. I'm just not ready to start hoping again. I held out hope longer than most, and only recently lost it completely. It will take bit more to get me to believe in them again. You have made some very good points here. Sony has been putting more and more of their eggs on the PlayStation basket, and Xperia has fallen to the wayside. Such a shame. Maybe they do a deal and give away a PS4 Pro or Slim with every purchase of this and I guarantee you this'll sell, frankly that'll be the ONLY way it will sell decently in the US. Yeah and then they f*cked up the PS4 Pro as badly as possible. Definitely have to agree with this entirely. Very well said. Agree 100%.  I think what makes this so frustrating for me is that I want Sony to succeed and I know they can do better. I don't think this XZ is their comeback.  I'm no longer fooled in the one step forward, two steps back. Sony you can compete, but whoever has been in charge for the last couple years has no clue how to. Posted via the Android Central App I have to agree. Sony can do way better. The XPERIA XZ is a step in the right direction if the general consensus from critics are positive. But in a highly competitive market, especially when the likes of OnePlus exist, to charge a premium price tag, you need a compelling killer feature that totally sets it apart and justifies the premium. Sony hasn't got that yet, so they have to either make a compelling feature or reduce the price a bit. Looks like a pretty nice phone actually. Yes,  a very nice phone. I know it's a second opinion from the androidcentral ( very nice article BTW ). But I'd love to see Micheal Fisher's take on this phone. Please Androidcentral let Micheal play with this phone. Yeah. I like the waterproofing that Sony phones have. I've missed that with my Nexus, but the updates are nice.",The Xperia XZ gives me hope that Sony can turn things around in the U.S.

         Sony's late-2016 handsets are official — the Xperia XZ, a new flagship-tier phone with the latest Sony camera tech, and the Xperia X Compact, a trimmed down version in a 4.6-inch body. If you're wondering how both phones stack up in terms of raw specs, we've got all the info you need down below. the Z presence in (XZ) can restore what used to make the Z line stand out Blue Mist X Compact, I might have to. And here we are again. 2 perfectly capable phones once ruined by very minor deficiencies.
1. Sony Xperia XZ. This phone , just like Xperia X Performance and HTC 10, isn't a bad phone by any means. Infact this is really a great device, but it is it's price that will let it down against its competition. By the time Xperia XZ makes it to the market, Samsung Galaxy S7 will already be available for at least 150-200 $(may be even 250$) less than this phone and with a much more global availability. Not to forget the small time but really capable phones like Huawei P9, P9 Plus, Honor 8 and ZTE Axon 7(damn that phone costs 400$ with 2 years warranty). I don't know how can one convince someone to buy an Xperia XZ instead of those phones except that Galaxy S7 has a Glass back which I completely despise.
So what Sony should have done to really make this still brilliant smartphone stand in the crowd was:
i. They should have outed it with Snapdragon 821, even if that processor really doesn't add up much to the user experience, but still. If Asus can get their hands on that processor for Zenfone 3 Deluxe, why couldn't Sony.
ii. For a FHD display, I am totally fine with 3 GB ram, but again, to stand out and really look eye to eye to the bigger and more potent players, they should have outed it with 64 GB base storage. WTH Sony, Huawei P9 Plus and ZTE Axon 7 can do that, but you can't.
iii. In a 7.9 mm and 7 mmthick body, Samsung and Huawei could accommodate 3000 mah batteries respectively, but sony in an 8.1 mm couldn't? Come on Sony, you can definitely do better than that.
iv. Launch it either with a price equivalent to Galaxy S7's launching price, or even better, for a lesser price. That would really give them a head start at least against the upcoming LG V-20 and IP 7.
2. Sony Xperia X Compact. Well one simple thing, SD 652 instead of 625 and price it at least equivalent to either Huawei P9 or if they truly want to make a mark, then Honor 8. That would have really put Xperia X compact on everyone's radar, but for now, I don't have a very good feeling for both these devices. Sigh! Need - Bigger - Screen - Option.  XZ Compact - XZ Mini - XZ Plus :( ..... or XZ Premium   :p That forest blue looks so hot! I hope they price it reasonably or I can simply buy the S7, which is on discount at many places. You'll be better served with the S7. Any idea why I can't view this article on a desktop. It comes up with access denied. Use the app, they have more or less abandoned the site. Lol,  what the heck? They have?! I don't know what that guy is saying. Don't be so shocked. What's the aperture of the rear camera on the XZ? f/2.0 It's not the widest around, but it's reasonable and you'll still get a nicely blurred background at macro distances thanks to the larger 1/2.3"" sensor. No Verizon support. No Sprint support. EPIC FAIL! No support for standards nowhere else in the World exist anymore except in those two American carriers. Yeah. From all the things, THAT is where these phones fail... Maybe those networks should switch to globally used standards? Well, these are... Phones. They're nice enough, but I can't see a reason someone would choose one over something like an S7. And they'll likely be priced similarly. If priced similarly, that is funny...and almost dead on arrival. Better sound quality through both speakers and headphone jack, higher resolution camera, no touchwiz, no AMOLED, stamina mode performance is superb, I think even waterproofing is better on Sony phones. Only for the diehard Sony fans... No AMOLED is not something to brag about. Samsung's AMOLED screens make Sony's crappy LCDs look like sh*t. used the z5c for few weeks and returned it. Screen wasn't that great and sd810 heat issues were crazy.. the camera would not work for more than 8 minutes... recently bought s7 (always wanted smaller device).. significantly better phone overall.. would have loved to see s7 mini with true flagship specs! Maybe the XZ is better, but the headphone playback performance on the X Performance is nothing special. Speakers are pretty solid, however. Can someone tell me about Sony's ""design language"" (did i use the term correctly)? Why do they even make these compact phones with a smaller screen size when they only end up being larger than they should be because of the uhm 'spaces' on the upper and lower  sections of the phone? You used it correctly. I think when it comes to smaller phones, people don't care as much about bezels (that's what the spaces are called). The 'spaces' on the bezels are there for the stereo speakers. It's the side bezels, and over all width that matter most when it comes to one handed use. As a Z5 owner, you stop noticing the bezels. I like them.  Hopefully they can do better than Moto, HTC and LG in the US. I'm a fan of QHD displays. 1080p is very nice, but once you've been using a QHD display for over a year, you can tell the difference. Plus I like throwing a VR headset on my mug occasionally. Beautiful phones though. Forgot to mention the XZ is waterproof and the X Mini (this is no true Compact) isn't. z5c user  sad to see sony  make people who want a pocket size phone have to swallow a much lower spec device yet still try to claim flag ship status RIP Sony ""Compact"" . At least they aren't going full retard with entry-level specs. Yeah it is unfortunate that it's not a 'true' compact edition. certainly not a compact flagship any more. lower spec cpu lower spec gpu lower spec front camera .will have to stick with z5c until another company starts making a premium waterproof pocket size phone ... That's running a 720p display. GPU power is a complete non issue. I'm a fan of the X Compact coming out first. That mist blue color is nice. The pricing would be nice to know. Price - assume higher than you really think it's worth... this is Sony after all. Aha comment of the day. You are correct. If it launches higher than what I paid for the Honor 8, I will be keeping the Honor. Why launch with Marshmallow? Seems counterproductive to launch top end hardware with old software. Im sure 80 or even 90% android users doesnt care too much about their android version... better release older but stable than newer but unstable. You've made a point Most of the phones being released now have been in development for the past year.  Makes sense to me to wait until the bugs in N have been worked out and just release an update when it's ready, Name a phone you can buy right now that comes with Nougat? To be honest, I don't really consider 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage to be ""top end hardware"" at this point.  It's enough, but it's mediocre. This Well, Nougat may have been available to OEMs for a while, but it's probably best that OEMs spend a bit more time working out the kinks. Yeah, I know the LG V20 will ship with it, but I wouldn't be surprised if they had to spend a bit more time polishing it. Yeah, lets wait and see how many catches there are with the V20 and Nougat. I suspect there will be some. Be it bugs. Be it availability. Be it features. Maybe all 3. Gotta catch 'em all. :P",Sony Xperia XZ + X Compact specs

         Sony's late-2016 flagship is the phone it needed six months ago, with some of the most important upgrades in years for an Xperia phone. But is it enough? The more things change, the more they stay the same. With the apparently sunsetting of the Xperia Z line and the move to Xperia X, Sony appeared to have lost interest in the traditional spec-chasing high-end smartphone game. Yet here we are less than half a year later with a new Sony flagship: The Xperia XZ. The naming convention speaks to the nature of the phone: A continuation of the X series spearheaded earlier this year with the Xperia X and X Performance, but with hints of the old Xperia Z brand: A bigger screen, a more capacious battery, and some seriously important camera upgrades — including, for the first time in a Sony phone, hardware stabilization. This is the phone Sony needed half a year ago — and arguably a device which is more of a complete through than the overpriced, underwhelming X Performance. But the competition in the high-end space hasn't died down since the spring, and the XZ will face a similar band of challengers as its immediate predecessor. So how does the most interesting Sony phone in two years measure up? Read on to find out. The Sony Xperia XZ is a return to form for the manufacturer, with a much-improved camera, a more interesting chassis design and solid performance in other areas. But some nagging issues remain, such as the general dullness of Sony's hardware, and the inexplicable lack of fingerprint security in the U.S. models. And although the camera is a lot better than any other Sony phone, it's not as dependable as Samsung's latest. We're publishing this review after four days with a pre-production U.S.-spec Sony Xperia XZ (model F8331) in Berlin, Germany on the Telekom.de network. Our review unit was using software version 39.0.A.1.205, based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with the 1 July 2016 Android security patch.  As we've come to expect from Sony, the Xperia XZ is a big rectangular slab of a phone. But unlike some earlier Sony models, the design balance is skewed more in favor of ergonomics in the XZ. The comfort factor stems from the fact that it's composed, like the Xperia X, of a polycarbonate trim and metal back panel. This time the metal and plastic combo is handled differently — the plastic curves around the frame of the device, while the polished metal panel sits around the back, with subtle curves on its edges.  Together with the slight taper of the edges of the front glass, this gives the Xperia XZ a pleasing symmetry. However there's no avoiding that the main contact points are with plastic, not metal. And that plastic frame makes it feel somewhat less premium than last year's Z5, with its aluminum border. In design terms, it feels a bit like one step forward, two steps back — a decision made perhaps for monetary, not aesthetic reasons. The outer trim houses a familiar collection of buttons — power, volume and a dedicated camera key all along the right edge. In the United States you'll miss out on the fingerprint security that's been a standard feature in other parts of the world for the past couple of generations of Sony phones, which is unfortunate. As with the Xperia X, the power button on the XZ is just a plain old button, and that's a big omission for what's supposed to be a flagship smartphone. (Again, economics seem to be conspiring against the user.) The top and bottom edges are completely flat, with a USB Type-C slot down below and 3.5mm headphone jack up top. Standard stuff — however Sony's now taking advantage of Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 for faster refills, which is a welcome addition. This is a big phone in all directions, with hefty top and bottom bezels, along with a relatively girthy thickness of 8.1mm. And that contributes to a slightly frumpy look compared to the likes of the Galaxy Note 7 — particularly given its relatively small 5.2-inch screen size. This isn't an ugly phone per se, but it is hard to enthuse over what is a relatively bland design, save for one or two visual flourishes. It's solid, not exciting. We can't complain about the quality of the display though. It's an LCD panel with Sony's ""TRILUMINOS"" branding, and buzzwords aside we've found it to be as clear and vibrant as any display in an Android phone, even under direct sunlight. Nor have we noticed any excessive distortion at wide viewing angles. Top-notch internals inside a relatively bland shell. The Samsung Galaxy S7 (and others) have the XZ beaten on sheer pixel density, but in every other area it's a top-notch screen. And it's backed up by Sony's image enhancement software, including X-Reality for enhancing contrast and sharpness in photos and video. As we've always said, 1080p at this screen size is perfectly fine, and I didn't find myself missing the extra density of Samsung's latest displays. On the audio side, Sony continues its use of front-facing stereo speakers that do a decent job of putting out plenty of volume, but lack the bass of competitors like HTC. Thankfully the phone has plenty of audio tricks up its sleeve in other areas, with the ability to upsample compressed music to high-res quality when using wired headphones.  Internally, the XZ packs in standard high-end Android internals — a Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB internal storage. And powering the whole assembly is a 2,900mAh internal battery — a welcome upgrade from the 2,620mAh of the Xperia X. We'll discuss battery longevity later in this review, but the phone always performed admirably — the only performance lag we noticed was during the initial setup, where the phone was updating apps over an LTE connection. And gaming performance impressed too, with the Adreno 530 handling 1080p gaming with ease. A big upgrade for Sony's cameras — including, for the first time, hardware stabilization. The internals may be mostly the same, but Sony's camera hardware has undergone some significant upgrades. For the first time, the rear camera sports hardware stabilization — a 5-axis stabilization solution that Sony says has not yet been offered to partners — backed up by laser autofocus and a new color spectrum sensor around the back. The sensor itself is a 23-megapixel Exmor RS unit, similar to the Xperia X, offering a similar balance of fine detail in daylight scenes. The new stabilization capabilities allow the XZ to boast improved low-light performance though — something we'll explore in further detail later in this review. The Xperia XZ is also one of the few phones able to boast water resistance — something Sony has a long history with, but a characteristic only it and Samsung are currently offering. It's a much needed differentiator for the company, and something which gives added peace of mind when using the phone around a pool or in heavy rain. Sony has all the specs, some unique camera hardware, and most of the audio and video bells and whistles... and yet the company seems to be treading water when it comes to design. As such, it's difficult to see how anyone but die-hard Sony fans will be getting excited about the look and feel of the Xperia XZ. Calling it boring seems harsh, but that's where we are in the smartphone market of 2016.  Over the past year Sony has toned down its customization of Android considerably, focusing on differentiated apps and services, while leaving the core of Google's Material Design interface alone. That trend continues into the company's newest handsets; the XZ's software is largely a mirror image of the Xperia X. The main aesthetic flourishes center around Sony's stylized lock screen and launcher, as well as a handful of the company's own apps, like the Material-style weather app. For the first time, Sony's launcher can incorporate a Google Now panel.  A first outside of the Google Now Launcher — at least officially — Sony's home screen setup is able to bring Google Now into the mix through its own vertical-scrolling pane on the leftmost home screen panel. That's a helpful addition that lets you stick with Sony's home screen setup if you prefer the greater customization and app suggestions it provides, while also keeping Google's predictive capabilities at your fingertips. Elsewhere, it's all about smaller tweaks to a largely vanilla Android experience: Things like custom quick settings buttons, a Sony launcher with suggested apps and recommended downloads, and Google's Doze mode augmented by Sony's proven ""Stamina"" mode, which cuts back on background data and CPU performance to extend battery life.  Aside from the usual stuff — things like the Sony Album and Music apps — there's a new News Reader application that can get a little notification-happy, and Sony's ""What's New"" app for keeping on top of new apps and other content. All of these link into Sony's broader ecosystem, but the integration between the preloaded apps and Sony's services is handled in a way that's not a distraction if you prefer not to use them. Sony's software is lightweight, fast and approachable. So the day-to-day experience of using a Sony phone hasn't really changed from the Xperia X back in May. The only new features we were able to track down live in the Settings app — the new Smart Cleaner recreates the phone ""optimization"" features of rivals like Samsung and HTC, helping you clear out old files and optimize memory for frequently used apps. After our first week with the phone there's not too much cludge accumulated in the internal storage just yet, but this is a feature that may become more useful over time. And for total newbies, the Xperia Tips section provide interactive walkthroughs to help you get up and running. So that's Sony's software in a nutshell: lightweight, fast, and approachable. Other software bits:  Cameras have been a huge part of Sony's smartphones for as long as it's been making them. But the manufacturer has neglected to catch onto some of the more recent trends like optical stabilization and laser autofocus — technologies which have played an important part in some of the best phone cameras of this generation. No more. Finally, Sony has a smartphone with hardware stabilization — in fact, a new 5-axis stabilization tech adopted from the company's HandyCam camcorders. That's backed up by a color spectrum sensor, LED flash and laser autofocus to complete the smartphone camera trifecta. Sony continues to use a 23-megapixel Exmor RS sensor behind an f/2.0 lens, and by default the XZ downsamples to an 8-megapixel image. That means you've got plenty of wiggle room for zooming in while still retaining fine detail. During our time with the Xperia XZ, we alternated between 8- and 23-megapixel modes, before eventually settling on shooting at the maximum resolution. Hardware stabilization brings big improvements in indoor and low-light recording. The much-needed move to hardware stabilization brings some serious improvements to Sony's latest camera — especially in indoor and low-light conditions. For the most part, this is a dependable ""all-around"" camera that can produce good-looking photos in just about all situations. When Superior Auto mode gets things right — and it very often does — it'll select the perfect scene mode for you, and the result will be a genuinely impressive image. (Allowing for lighting, motion and your own skill, of course.) But there are caveats attached. First of all, it's easier than we'd like to capture blurry shots in darker conditions, and strangely Sony's stabilization system seems a little more susceptible to hand motion than the likes of Samsung and LG. Occasionally that new color spectrum sensor dramatically misfires, giving outdoor scenes an unnatural blue or green hue. And the same software confusion can trip up Superior Auto.  The other asterisk has to do with the 23-megapixel size, and the amount of sharpening going on when you zoom in. If you're taking photos at the full sensor size, be prepared for fine details to be mired in noise when you zoom in, and for there to be plenty of over-sharpening going on, to the point where images lose the natural look offered by the iPhone and some other competitors. It seems like the XZ's software processing just needs a little tune-up. It's entirely possible that'll happen before launch — after all, we're using a pre-production device here. Sony's camera app hasn't changed a whole lot since we last saw it in the Xperia X. A slider on the right edge lets you choose between Manual, Superior Auto+, video and Sony's various plug-in camera apps. (These include things like AR modes for adding dinosaurs to your snaps, to sweep panoramas mode, to the dedicated 4K shooting mode.) Most of the time, despite its occasional finickiness, you'll want to live in Auto+. For finer control, Manual lets you set select specific scene modes, set your ISO, enable HDR and object tracking, and tweak things like metering and timer settings. (Basically, everything you'd expect from a standalone digital camera.) Sony expects you to use Superior Auto+ most of the time — and you probably should. It'd be nice if some of these options were a little more discoverable, but Sony's clearly putting a lot of emphasis behind Superior Auto+. In video recording, Sony's stabilization tech really comes into its own, with smooth 1080p/60fps recording even in darker conditions with minimal amounts of noise. And 4K recording is also supported, though with the usual heat-related warnings. Given the file size constraints of 4K, you'll want to stick to 1080p most of the time. So overall this is easily Sony's best phone camera yet, but it doesn't quite reach the standards of Apple and Samsung in terms of guaranteed brilliance every time. Sony's getting close though, and with some software updates the Xperia XZ could be a real challenger. Other camera-related nuggets:  I've been using the Sony Xperia XZ for just four days at the time of writing, so I'm still getting the hang of the phone's day-to-day battery performance. What's more, we've been pushing it harder than we normally would at the IFA show in Berlin. Travel is hard on phones.  That said, we have a reasonable idea of how the Xperia XZ performs in the real world, and the verdict is that it's a solid ""one-day"" phone, but no more than that unless you're using it really sparingly. That's about par for the course for a Snapdragon 820 running a 5.2-inch screen on a battery of this size. We were regularly getting between 12 and 14 hours out of the Xperia XZ working on LTE all day, before hitting Battery Stamina mode at 30 percent charge. That's with around 3 hours of screen on time up to that point, which is a respectable showing for a current Android phone. We'd liken it to what some of our editors have been getting from the OnePlus 3 in recent weeks. As mentioned, Battery Stamina mode can step in to save the day when you're running low on charge, and Sony includes both regular Stamina and Ultra Stamina modes depending on just how much functionality you want to cut back in the name of battery life. There's a noticeable performance hit when Stamina is enabled though, so it's probably not something you'll want to get into the habit of using. And when it's time to charge, the latest Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 means you're never below 50 percent for long. On balance, we're reasonably happy with the battery performance we've been getting from the Xperia XZ. You may be disappointed if you're coming from an earlier Xperia phone with truly phenomenal longevity. But for most people it's going to be perfectly fine.  Sony is almost back on top form. The Xperia XZ is a solid all-round handset that does a lot of things right — a handset to restore the faith of Sony fans. Its greatest sin is probably looking a little dull — this is no Galaxy Note 7, after all — but once you look path its monolithic exterior there's a lot to like. Sony bucks the trend of 2K displays and instead goes with a fantastic looking 1080p panel, with power savings as a result. Performance is speedy across the board, and Sony's software is thoughtful and measured. And we're finally seeing a significant leap forward in camera performance in an Xperia phone, with big hardware additions that result in better photos almost every time. The problem for Sony, like so many other Android manufacturers, is the fact that Samsung'
 absolutely crushing it this year. Sony's camera is great, but it's not the best. Same deal with its screen, its build quality and its battery life. And U.S. buyers once again get the short end of the stick, as Sony cheaps out on fingerprint security. As such, the XZ's appeal is likely limited to hardcore Sony fans. And if that's you, then you'll be getting a hell of a phone. I get a kick out of the ""Cons"" with ""Boring design"". Are you kidding me? Sony makes the most beautiful phones available. You want to see boring? Look at the Pixel. When you look up the word ""boring"" in the dictionary, they have a photo of the Pixel phone. I want this phone as my next upgrade, this is coming from a Windows Phone guy that is tired of the app ecosystem of Windows Phone/Mobile 10 and has switched to Android (Sony Xperia M4 Aqua). I love waterproof phones, I'll never go back to a non water resistant phone. Thanks pops for this wonderful phone I love these phones and my dad knows I love them and this one is no different it's sunny with a great camera fast processor and a beautiful screen that'll make it just let yourself your inhibitions Run free felt like watching Easy Rider on the screen Felt So Good I feel like Dennis Hopper in a pimp hat when I was with my phone for the very first time I have the black in the black is sexy it's kind of Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption except without the sad stuff phone is so pimp Just cut it in stone: 5 phones a year, release every 6 months! 2 mids with 1 big-bear flag. Then 1 flag with 1 small-bear flag. I just listened to your Android Central Podcast ""304: IFA 2016 Crossover Special"" Y'all were so down on the Sony XZ, but I also do agree with y'all on your review that they should have released it 6 months ago with the X series. The thing is Sony tries to brand ""Compact"" as same specs as the flagship in a smaller size, as there's a market need for a smaller size phone as iPhone 6c showed. Just sometimes they loose their way like they did with the ""Ultra"" branding. I just wish X Performance specs were in the XA Ultra screen size of 6 inches, to be sorta-comparable against the Note 7. The original marketing pitch for the Z Ultra was a top specs of the time in a large screen and can use a pen without an ""S Pen"" just any writing object. Ultra lost it's meaning when they made the T2 Ultra, C5 Ultra, and XA Ultra. Sony's team can't draw a line: I'm telling you. just make ""Compact"" Hi-Specs small size. ""Ultra"" High-Specs past 6 inches range, never under. Just cut it in stone: 5 phones a year, release every 6 months! 2 mid-range with 1 Ultra. Then 1 flag with 1 Compact. Gotta love the phone Thanks for the review, am a fan and I would definitely buy it. True boring design. Nice Phil. You almost had me. I have a Z3 for work.  I really don't like it at all.  Sony is no longer an option for me at all. Ouch. I still have my Z3 Compact even though I rarely use it anymore. I'd buy another Sony phone but not one without a fingerprint sensor, I've just grown too used to the convince of using it to unlock the phone and with apps like 1Password and my banking software. Have they still not fixed the photograph naming issue yet? i'd love a sony but that issue has kept me from buying one Reviewing a phone that isn't even out until October? Seems Legit... Just sold my Z3 and miss it alread. Still a really fast phone with concept software on it but I wont be upgrading to this Sony phone due to boring design, lack lustre specs/camera and dodgy update path. I like this new Sony might even be my next buy. Especially the blue model. And where I live it will got the fingerprint sensor also. Definitely a sony with those huge top and bottom bezels. I thought that the new release of sony Z series would have a 4k display :P WHY does Sony intend on gimping the fingerprint sensor on all its US phones? Deal breaker for me. Hey Sony,  the Z2 called and said it wants it's thick bezels back.  Posted via the Android Central App Look at the forehead and chin on that thing! Ugly! Almost 4 years already, and Sony is still stuck on ""8 mp resolution in Auto Mode"" whether it is a 20.7 mp camera or a 23 MP cam. I mean come on Sony, WTH. You still haven't learnt how to make a 23 MP camera in Auto mode despite supplying camera sensors to almost 80% smartphone manufacturers globally. That's definitely a let down. they are using over sampling technology so they are actually using the full 23mp camera sensor's capability. The automode 8mp pictures are down-scaled 23mp pictures. Sigh... I *was* kinda excited about this phone. Not anymore. Mediocre camera and no fingerprint reader in the US version, no sale. Not for me. And I liked the look of their Z-series devices better (I still miss my Z3). This is just... ""meh."" Very disappointing. I see Phil walking by in the background pretending to be a local. Phil b like pimp with that awesome Sony phone One thing that doesn't get mentioned about Sony devices is the fact that you get PS4 remote play and native PS4 controller support for Android gaming. I use it a lot and it's a great feature.
That aside, hopefully they got their Bluetooth audio issues dealt with because the Z5 has crap Bluetooth audio playback. It keeps skipping. I had the bluetooth skip issue on my Z3 compacts - but the latest release seems to have fixed it. (fingers crossed!) Oh hell I have that on Motorola so what's the big deal wants a Bluetooth disconnect all the time if I had a dollar for everytime disconnected hell I have enough to get a new Bluetooth It's really disappointed to see a Japanese company used to be the technology pioneer becoming a technology conservative Some of these companies aren't hungry anymore. Sony seems pre-occupied  with other things. The name Sony used to be synonymous with top notch electronics. For 30 years they had the best tvs, now they are getting hammered by Samsung and Vizio. I can't think of a single Sony product that I own or want to own.  They just don't have that drive anymore, everything they make now seems lackluster. Their camera industry is doing well though, relatively. The mirror less cameras they make is second to none Posted via the Android Central App Cameras are awesome on this phone and I'm a big gamer so let me tell you there's nothing like gaming on my Sony What are you talking about Sony still hungry there like eating short stacks at Denny's I like it's design. It's simple. And here we are again. 2 perfectly capable phones once ruined by very minor deficiencies.
1. Sony Xperia XZ. This phone , just like Xperia X Performance and HTC 10, isn't a bad phone by any means. Infact this is really a great device, but it is it's price that will let it down against its competition. By the time Xperia XZ makes it to the market, Samsung Galaxy S7 will already be available for at least 150-200 $(may be even 250$) less than this phone and with a much more global availability. Not to forget the small time but really capable phones like Huawei P9, P9 Plus, Honor 8 and ZTE Axon 7(damn that phone costs 400$ with 2 years warranty). I don't know how can one convince someone to buy an Xperia XZ instead of those phones except that Galaxy S7 has a Glass back which I completely despise.
So what Sony should have done to really make this still brilliant smartphone stand in the crowd was:
i. They should have outed it with Snapdragon 821, even if that processor really doesn't add up much to the user experience, but still. If Asus can get their hands on that processor for Zenfone 3 Deluxe, why couldn't Sony.
ii. For a FHD display, I am totally fine with 3 GB ram, but again, to stand out and really look eye to eye to the bigger and more potent players, they should have outed it with 64 GB base storage. WTH Sony, Huawei P9 Plus and ZTE Axon 7 can do that, but you can't.
iii. In a 7.9 mm and 7 mmthick body, Samsung and Huawei could accommodate 3000 mah batteries respectively, but sony in an 8.1 mm couldn't? Come on Sony, you can definitely do better than that.
iv. Launch it either with a price equivalent to Galaxy S7's launching price, or even better, for a lesser price. That would really give them a head start at least against the upcoming LG V-20 and IP 7.
2. Sony Xperia X Compact. Well one simple thing, SD 652 instead of 625 and price it at least equivalent to either Huawei P9 or if they truly want to make a mark, then Honor 8. That would have really put Xperia X compact on everyone's radar, but for now, I don't have a very good feeling for both these devices. Sorry,  my bad. Xperia X Compact already has Snapdragon 650. Now all it needs is an aggressive price tag. Hell yeah I would have paid a thousand for this phone I don't give a darn I love my Sony they last forever Can someone please explain WHY Sony doesn't put fingerprint sensor on the US version? What is the point? Anyways, this looks good. But the price will make or break it. As with most other Sony phones. To cut costs. The US isn't a priority for them and the trouble of going through the extra regulatory approvals that hardware with biometric sensor has to go would be expenses that wouldn't be compensated by sales of the devices. It's just easier and cheaper to remove it. Cut costs? Don't they already cut enough costs with some of the things they skimp out on?  Huh? Sony is convinced they're the Apple of Android. In case you haven't realised it yet ;) I guess that would explain it. :P What are you talking about they got some of the best materials on the phone online HTC in there Boost Mobile plastic The fingerprint scanner actually is there in the US model, it's just disabled by software. Yeah dude if you disable it you can do it you can have it I have it that's why I'm saying people be trippin it's cuz it loses it function like a fingerprint who gives a darn do you really want your fingerprints all over your phone Oh shut up so he's one of the best companies in the world way above Samsung Samsung would have to make a spaghetti dinner just to entertain Sony No one knows why the finger print scanner isn't enabled, there's no explanation from Sony.  Guess is that someone owns the patent in the US for a similar system and Sony doesn't want to pay the $$$ to either buy it or use it.  Still sucks though. That's my understanding. Read somewhere it was a patent HP had in-house or otherwise acquired. Also does it by chance have a small slot or cut in on the body for a camera wrist strap? Again I loved that about the z3 Alex Dobie will you guys potentially re-visit the camera? I'm really hoping it's just pre production issues. I want to love sony. I really do. My z3 was fantastic but everything after the z3 was just mediocre or worse. Their cameras always excited till I read the reviews. Also does it do slow mo at more than 120 fps? Can you control the fps for slow mo? If you're waiting for an update to improve the camera processing, I wouldn't hold your breath. I've been waiting literally years for Sony to improve its camera software. It's not going to happen. As much as we complain about Sony's tired design, If Sony released a Z3 body with today's updated specs, how many of us would jump on that? I'd be 1st in line.  Oh course Sony isn't in the business of making us happy anymore.  Posted via the Android Central App Depends. If it was a real Compact or a Mini like the Xperia X Mini they launched. Maybe...  If it had equal or better battery capacity.
If the camera was good.
If they could be trusted with updates.
If the price wasn't too high. I have no confidence in any of those things any more. Amazon UK has the X Compact for pre-order for £379.
My Z3C, on pre-order, cost me £349. I think there's nothing else to say regarding price. The Z series have been very good for the latest android updates. My Z2 tablet and Z3 compact both have 6.0.1 and regular security patch/updates. (June o/s build) How are they for security patches? Because my Z3 is well behind. It also took a long time to get Marshmallow. Also, the Z3 which is less than 2 years old won't be getting Nougat.  So I don't trust them with updates at all. Switch to concept software, you won't regret it! Yelp Sony's been on top of it same as always Sony is one of the best companies in the world My black Note 7 actually reminds me a lot of the Z3 I used to have. lol My S7 the same.
And that's because the S7 line from Samsung is what Sony *could* have done 2/3 years ago if they had listened to their users instead of insisting they know best. Now that you mention it, it kinda does. This phone just released, how can you guys have a full review already? Sony gave reviewers pre-production devices prior to the launch. Duh.
This is awfully common in case you haven't noticed ;) I think the saddest thing about this is that this phone ticks the boxes of what most people on this site want in a phone, but it won't be widely available or adopted. Front facing speakers, good battery life, camera with OIS, no camera hump, water proofing, SD card slot, USB C, quick charge 3.0, nearly stock Android that's fast and has minimal bloat. And no one will buy it. About that last point: most don't care if stock Android or stockISH Android comes aboard. Mostly Nexus snobs care and they are a small bunch in comparison to the common consumer who much prefer iPhone and Galaxy. Well I did say most people on this site. And I also references not just stock Android but also speedy software. The phone is fast I blazed through apps like you wouldn't believe I had like 46 of them open They just refuse to go to 4gb's of ram.  They were ahead of pack for years with 3, but now... I have no problem with Sony's understated design and large bezels if the rest of the experience is top notch or remarkable, but again, it doesn't seem that it is.  No fingerprint sensor, on a phone this size? There's a fingerprint scanner. Just not in the US. How can any phone be considered a flagship device in 2016, WITHOUT a fingerprint scanner? I was really looking forward to this phone and I feel like they got alot of things back on track now. I only wish it had 4GB of RAM, either then that, this seems pretty awesome. Interesting review. Pretty much a summary review. Not much if anything said about the software experience which was my favorite part of the Z3. A lot said about the camera, but not much about the camera software, does it load up quickly? Focus quickly? The jabs on the device as inferior to others because of lack of a fingerprint sensor are interesting. I'm still not seeing the fingerprint sensor as a selling point on any mobile device as a security advantage over a good password. Hopefully this is just a pre-review? About the finger print reader...
Time is money.
Finger print saves time over typing quality password.
Time savings over 2 years generates enough money to buy new phone with something that's more secure than a password. So what we don't need a fingerprint scanner the only thing if you have Sprint does it make you look guilty Completely agree.  Phone reviews these days rarely cover the important aspects, especially android central's.  Also,  I don't understand all the displeasure towards the design of Sony's phones at Android Central.  They're beautiful.  My Z3 was easily nicer than any samsung i've owned.  Snappier too.  For some reason, A.Central don't like to mention the snappiness of phones, which to me is majorly important.  If they did, I don't think samsung's phones would get such good reviews here. You see that thing waaaay back there, that almost indistinguishable spot on the horizon that you passed a long time ago? That was the shark. I've always loved the look of Sony phones but they're always so expensive Well god damn, Sony's back in the game! You go Sony, you go. I'm glad they've bucked the 2K screen trend. As someone who went from a Z2 to a Priv I can confirm that 2K is a gimmick, though a nice one. I'd much prefer better performance and battery life, considering I rarely take advantage of the 2K screen (2K youtube results in sound and a frozen picture :| ). Hopefully Sony get their butts into gear after this and avoid dropping steamers like the Z4 or any of the X range. 1080P, 3GB, and no fingerprint scanner... Return of the flagship?  I am confused? This looks just like the Xperia X Performance with a little bigger display that was released in June and rejected by the market. This a Sony ad or a AC post? There's a few other upgrades in tow. Especially the camera, since the one on the XPERIA X was actually kinda shameful. No fingerprint scanner IN THE US. Everywhere else in the world there's a fingerprint scanner on the home button.  And since there's far more important World outside the US (specially for Sony) that's not even a problem. The rest is. Yes, IN THE US. That's where I am located so it would obviously be very relevant to me. Well, the reviewer is British. Hence the ""return of the flagship"" ;) My mom's at the flagship right now she's been sitting on it for 2 months across the Persian sea My favorite phone to this day was my z3, I wish I hadn't traded it in for a Samsung note two years ago. Like all Sony phones, it seems like this is a good phone all around. Sure, it's not the best in all categories, but no phone is perfect. Competition is so fierce right now, with little to differentiate the phones. If you don't like Samsung, which I don't, then it's a hard call. And with Google stepping up the Nexus line, and this year's phone, it makes it even harder to decide. And, I want all companies to do well, as the competition will just make them better. A couple minor complaints about the phone - what's with the weird little panel at the bottom of the rear panel? As for the rounded sides, I personally prefer the flat sides of the original Z. Meant that I could prop the phone on a table to take timer photos. Can't do that with the rounded edges. Also, did I miss it or does the phone not have expandable storage? edit: Nevermind, the other article says it supports up to 256GB SD Cards. Now the big question is going to be when will the phone actually be buyable. It looks pretty competitive now but if it's four months between preview and actual mass availability (like with the Xperia X series) it's going to be out of date again. The Sony Lumia 920. Without any of the Nokia qualities that is. Yep. This thing pales in comparison to the design of classic Lumias. Oh yeah I forgot about that Glad I'm not the only one... All I could see was the 920 body. It's an extremely boring design though, to be honest. Yeah but the 920 was a phenomenal phone in its day. One of the best built and designed phone. I once threw it a car and caused a 10 car collision. Built like a tank. As you'd expect from the company that makes the legendary 3310. :P Thanks let's not forget the s Similar but not quite the same. Also the L920 is still heavier than this phone. That thing was a brick. I'll have to see this phone in person before making any judgements on it. I currently own a Z3 and it's slowly starting to show it's age so I'm ready for something new. This may be it. However, I am curious if/when Nokia brings anything out if it will be something decent. I always laugh when I see comments about heavy phones. It was like carrying a rock around in your pocket and believe it or not it did get tiring holding it a long time. No I'm not a pansy either. It's just a fact. I used it for almost two years so I'm not just saying things for the heck of it. It had a curved back and Qi wireless charging though. This doesn't. That's why I said it was similar. The L920 had a curved back. The Z3 doesn't have Qi either and I get by just fine. As much as wireless charging is nice I don't really needed and rarely used it when I had the L920. I had a girl date me just because I have that phone it was so pimp The biggest issue I see is launching with Marshmallow. The official AOSP code drop for Nougat has already happened and I daresay Sony (along with the other OEMs) would've had early access to the official code drop. If LG can get a phone running Nougat out in September, why can't Sony (or any of the other OEMs)? Nothing is launching with Nougat right now. Nothing. There are many things to criticise Sony for, but not having Nougat right now isn't one of them.  Blame them in 6 months when it doesn't have Nougat, and blame them again a year from that when they announce they're dropping support for it. But don't blame them yet. The upcoming LG V20 will launch with Nougat. Makes you wonder if Sony has fallen asleep at the wheel given that they would've also had early access to the final AOSP build of Nougat. The key word there is 'upcoming'. That phone hasn't been formally announced yet. And even when it has, we don't know when it will ship, and where it will be available.  And let's wait and see just how Nougat-y their Nougat is.  Point being, there's still nothing out there that comes with Nougat, and shaming Sony for being part of that is silly. Yeah, V20 has been announced. It's real Nougat, notification shade and all (even if it is now a bright white). Split Window there. They even had a more uphill climb: Second Screen and dual camera features take extra time to work, but they managed it anyway. And it's launching by the end of the month. I see no reason why the Xperia XZ, with a much lighter skin, simpler hardware and launching in October, can't run Nougat out-of-the-box. I have to say, I wasn't expecting this to have OIS, let alone 5-axis OIS, plus laser AF and a color-spectrum sensor. That's some serious hardware upgrades for the camera over past XPERIAs, though I still have to question whether we get a true-blue manual mode and the ability to focus while recording video. Also whether the heat issues have been mitigated. Furthermore, is this using a glass lens rather than a plastic lens like on the Z5P? Camera discussion aside, this is probably the phone that Sony really has to bank on after a pretty disappointing first-half of 2016 with the initial offerings in the XPERIA X-lineup. It gets a lot right, with strong hardware (even if some might find the 1080p display and 3GB of RAM a bit on the 2014-side, but shouldn't be much of an issue in the real-world) and light software. Personally, I prefer the look of the Z5, but I find this a pretty understated-looking phone. Though the bezels probably could do with some trimming. BUT, there's still no fingerprint sensor in the US. Some people probably wouldn't give a crap about that, but launching a premium device in the US without one just seems overly silly at this point. On the website Sony boasts about manual shutter speed and focus controls. Whether that's true remains to be seen. It's true. Btekt on YouTube recently did a short video quickly covering the manual controls. I saw that video. Definitely something that Sony's phone cameras could use, but in the future, perhaps a more-accessible ISO settings wheel plus a longer shutter speed option (slowest seems to be 1 second, according to Sony's website) would make it much more competitive.  Not sure if it shoots RAW, however. Btekt remarks that he can't find the setting. Well about bloody time!
And assuming that they won't limit that to the XZ, if the Compact is released for 400-450€, I might actually get it just for fun. I'm not expecting any of these to replace my S7 though even if I prefer Sony as a company tenfold over Samsung. I guess you and I have a similar mindset. We prefer Sony as a company, but we own Samsung devices (Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note7) because Sony hasn't made a phone worth talking about since the XPERIA Z3 until now. Will probably take a while before they can get their feet back, but the XZ feels like the step in the right direction. Let's hope they don't get the price horrifically wrong. Yup, pretty much. I'm just not sure if Sony's mobile division will live long enough for them to catch up =\
I see no real urge on Sony's behalf. They keep acting as if everything was fine and their phones were the last Cola in the desert. The time it took them to do things my Nokia 920 did in 2012 is unbelievable.
And then there's the prices and Sony's delusion that they're Apple. I really hope they bounce back but the market is more competitive than ever and they just don't seem to realise it. For my part I had this secret hope I'd be able to use one last Sony Compact phone before returning to Nokia.
Unfortunately that won't be happening. Oh well. Yeah, Sony is still pretty delusional when it comes to the overall handset market. From the looks of it, the XPERIA XZ is a much-improved handset from the earlier phones, but if Sony wants to command a super-premium price-tag for it, what compelling feature does Sony have that other phones don't, minus PlayStation integration? None. Even the PlayStation integration is now open to all Android devices through the PlayStation app. They literally have no compelling reason for consumers to buy their phones over the competition other than ""it's a Sony"".
Problem is, we're not in the 90's anymore. Water resistance. Them and Samsung (and I guess now Apple too) are like the only ones with it. From what I know anyways. How can they still not have a fingerprint sensor in the US? It's just inexplicable when you can get a phone for  $100 with one The hardware are there on the X and Z5. They're just disabled. Flash other regions ROM (FTF flie) and it will be enabled. No rooting or boot loader unlocking needed. The point is we shouldn't have to. Exactly. I wonder if there's some sort of licensing issue in the US you think after 3 generations they'd have those issues ironed out.  the z5 first had a fingerprint sensor, then the X whatever's earlier in the year, now this.  it's just funny at this point.  they obviously just don't care.  clueless. Review needs some going-through: occassionally refers to the device as the Xperia XR (working name) or ZX (typo). Funny how Sony has kept it's flagships stuck in 1080p displays and 3GB of RAM since 2014 (don't get me started with the Z5 Premium). When the Z2 came with 3GB of RAM, it was god-like, but 5 generations later it would be reasonable to step it up a notch. The only thing that differentiates this from the Z3 (again, from 2014) is the camera and the processor (and the system updates), with the Z3 having the looks and the battery life. Outside USA, the fingerprint sensor. Not so much. Eh, I'm fine with the 1080p screen.  At 5.2"", I really think you hit a point of diminishing returns at 1080p, and going higher than that has more costs than benefits. The lack of fingerprint sensor in the US, though... ugh.  I really hoped that that was just a one-off thing with the X line. I am not sure if 1080p is any good.  I struggle to read on my nexus 5X and the same text is brilliant on my Note Edge.  May be 1080p Amoled is good. At the same DPI, an RGB matrix (IPS) will always look sharper than a pentile matrix (most AMOLEDs) because each pixel has 3 independent subpixels, meanwhile a pentile matrix shares some subpixels with adjacent pixels. The thing is, at 500+ DPI (current QHD screens) pixels are so small you can't make the difference. In your case, the 5X has a 423 DPI vs. 540 or so in the Note Edge, so the latter has a definitely sharper screen. You also have to factor glass transparency (and width), digitizers, overall brightness and contrast in each screen to make a proper comparison. Resolution only doesn't tell the whole story. Yep. Samsung's Pentile sub pixels can never look as sharp at the same resolution. Too much gap in between sub pixels and on top, it has extra green sub, which makes it harder for proper calibration (true color reproduction). From what I understood the reason for their design, was power saving and life of the screen (burn in , dropping brightness). Supposedly blue is used more and burns (fades) at higher rate and the blank black space (gap) between the sub pixels draws less power because it's never lit up (as in LCD panels).
My old OG Moto X had sRGB even though it was  Amoled screen (also by Samsung) and burned so fast (in about 6 months) that was useless outdoors. I would say that it dimmed by 30 % + over that period-epic failure. ""harder for proper calibration"" Samsung panels are among the best callibrated in the world in phones. But AMOLED panels are, in fact, harder to calibrate. It doesn't mean that they can't achieve better calibration than IPS LED panels, though it will probably cost more work (money). I believe the same, 1080p is more than enough for that screen size, and it goes easy on the SoC / battery. I was just naming specs that were kept the same since 2014 (even if the RAM is faster or the screen better), which makes it harder to justify Sony's pricing of it's devices. They are by no means (well, maybe the SoC and camera) bleeding edge technology for today standards. Yeah, I'd very much rather have a LONGER lasting phone with a 1080P display than a 2K Quad HD display but I can only use it for significantly shorter periods. I mean, the Xperia Z2 I have can still cough up 5 hours screen on time on average when my mum's LG G4 could barely do 3 (bear in mind they're both on Marshmallow) and the display resolution is a big factor in this... Yep.
2k on cell phones is not necessary as much as the battery life and performance are.
It's cool to have it, but only when other priorities are taken care of. Absolutely, I wouldn't cripple performance and autonomy just in case I want to watch something in VR. The above comment about Xperia Z s1 vs. the Galaxy  edge was left by A-Normal-Guy you can google that better phones Sony that is How long has anyone seriously seeing anybody pimp out a ZTE is go up in the club and lay one down on the bar I don't think so funny yes but Sony is more pimp Regarding the camera, has Sony finally opened up the camera2api or are third party apps still prevented from accessing true manual controls? By your review it seems despite the improvement of the camera hardware, the software is still the usual nightmare. Which means, to me, if I were to get it, it'd require rooting and replacing software. They boast about manual focus and shutter speed controls on their website but can you confirm that? At least it has manual shutter speed now. Slightly disappointed. not enough internal storage. surely 64GB should be available. I will need to see one 'in the flesh' and there's no hint of an XZ compact? I like the continuation of the 'minimal skinning' of the interface. I may start to look seriously at the OnePlus 3 or the next Nexus? Nope, there is a compact: http://www.androidcentral.com/sony-xperia-x-compact-hands But this time, that Compact is not equally equipped. It is actually running on a midrange SD 650. thanks for the info. I watched the Sony press conference on youtube last night. I see that there is an X compact but as the poster below says, it's not the equivalent. I'm impressed by the OIS they have now introduced. I will have to compare them 'in the flesh'. I loved the Xperia Z line.  Z3 was godly,  Z5 was alright.... Sony has great software and even my old Z3 is smoother than my S7 edge overall. Yeah, the Xperia Z2 I have is on Marshmallow right now, and it screams right past the LG G4 my mum has ALSO on Marshmallow, it's almost hilarious actually. Better battery life and heat management, too! Shame about the camera they used here, it's good, but the GNote 3 I also have generally takes better photos, to say nothing of the G4 shots... Goes to show just how shameful Sony's cameras in their own phones have been. Remember that all these cameras you mentioned have SONY sensors, and so have nearly every ""best smartphone camera"" released, with the single exception of Nokia's Lumia cameras, which had Toshiba sensors AFAIK (meanwhile this proves how bad the HTC One M9's camera suite was: it used the same T4KA7 sensor as the Lumia 930, whose only complaint agains the camera was ""slow"", while the One M9 was ""slow"" and ""poor dynamic range"" and ""bad in low light"") Absolutely shows how important is software tuning Z3 was almost a perfect phone at that time if they included OIS. I always feel other phones suck at battery life after I sold my Z3 It really was that good huh? I knew I should've bought it instead of the Moto X 2014, it was only the equivalent of 50 USD more, but I was concerned about software updates (rightly so, but the Z3 only took 3 extra months to get MM if I'm not wrong, which is bearable). Still have my Z3 and it's great. I brag about this all the time how I went snorkeling in the ocean and recorded video with my Z3 to people.

         This is unfortunately the price you're still expected to pay for a Sony phone. Sony's latest flagship, the Xperia XZ, has made its way out in some regions around the world and is now ready to hit the U.S. as well. Starting on October 2, you'll be able to pick up an unlocked Xperia XZ for a hefty $699 from both Amazon and Best Buy, among other partnering retailers.  The Xperia XZ takes over very quickly after the delayed U.S. launch of the Xperia X Performance (which itself is already down to $585 unlocked), but this is indeed a full replacement for that phone. The Xperia XZ has a solid metal build with signature Sony design, a really nice 5.2-inch display and is powered by a Snapdragon 820 processor. It also has waterproofing, stereo speakers and Sony's best mobile camera setup yet. Unfortunately it's lacking a fingerprint sensor in the U.S., which is pretty ridiculous considering the suggested retail price of the phone and continues to be a trend with Sony's phones here. Nonetheless, if the Xperia XZ seems like the complete package you've been waiting for in the U.S., you're just over a week away from being able to order. More: Our full Sony Xperia XZ review If you're looking for something from Sony that's a bit smaller and less expensive, the new Xperia X Compact, which was announced alongside the XZ, is already up for pre-order on Amazon for $499 — it launches officially on September 25. Press release: Sony Mobile Communications (""Sony Mobile"") is pleased to announce that Xperia X Compact and Xperia XZ will be available unlocked in the United States starting September 25, 2016 for the Xperia X Compact and October 2, 2016 for Xperia XZ. Both smartphones can be purchased on Amazon, Best Buy and other participating retailers for a suggested retail price of $499.99 and $699.99, respectively, and will support GSM networks. The all new Xperia XZ represents the ultimate in Sony Xperia's state-of-the-art camera, video and audio capabilities. It starts with the introduction of Sony's allnew triple image sensing technology to the highly advanced 23MP camera, combining Predictive Hybrid Autofocus with two new sensors—Laser Autofocus and RGBC Infrared sensors—to clearly capture any moment in life with ease and accuracy in any light conditions with true-to-life colors. Video capabilities in Xperia XZ now include 4K recording and enhancements to our best-in-class SteadyShot® technology that deliver the most stable videos with the world's first 5-axis video stabilization in a smartphone. Beyond the camera and video advancements, Xperia XZ features an updated stereo dual microphone system with integrated noise cancellation to ensure that the immersive 3D stereo sound quality and reduced background noise match the outstanding 4K video quality. All of these features, along with a 5.2-inch Corning® Gorilla® Glass 4 Full HD display and a stunning loop surface design inspired by a monolithic form made with ALKALEIDO™ metal, gives you a stylish, durable and powerful smartphone loaded with the latest in audio-visual innovation from Sony. For those who prefer a compact smartphone, Xperia X Compact brings the same state-of-the-art camera, video and audio capabilities in a compact design that fits great in your pocket, purse or bag, as well as in your hand. Boasting a durable 4.6-inch Corning® Gorilla® Glass 4 HD 720p TRILUMINOS™ display, Xperia X Compact also boasts the world's first 5-axis video stabilization with fully enhanced SteadyShot image stabilization technology, allowing users to record smoother videos on the move or close up. I still have my OnePlus 2 and it works like a charm running android Nougat! Right I said NOUGAT! I used finger print like for a week and it was boring I say, never found a use of it. I don't understand why people make so big deal about it but make sense for the $699 price you better add it AND for 2016 where every damn phone coming with 4gb RAM and at least 3000mAh Sony could make up something better and add 1 more gb and 100mAh to its XZ and I would throw my money to buy it. The only thing I like about XZ is design and water resistant feature. Yes there are some other phones with that feature but they are not Sony... If OnePlus 4/ Huawei Honor 9 or whatever next line will be is going to be water resistant then bye bye any manufacture. BUT AS SOME PEOPLE SAYING HERE HEY BETTER HAVE A DEAL LIKE FOR UK PRE ORDER NOW AND GET HEADSETS OR SOMETHING. Selling phones without headphones in the box is already stupid enough idea (even if headphones are cheap ) especially for Sony. They make those damn things so just add cheap one in the damn box. This Smartphone will not Sale in United States. No U.S. Carrier wants it. Sony changes it's Top of the Line Smartphone's Name every 6 Months. For 700.00 it should come with a 50 inch HD TV. The Koreans are showing the Japaneses how it suppose to be done in the U.S. 700$ , ugh  Would go for the Moto Z Play  and buy the Instant Share Projector mod instead :) I remember paying $700 for the first iPhone. In 2007. When smartphones as we know them now, were a new frontier. Figured it would be expensive. Here in the UK one retailer is offering Sony bluetooth headphones on pre-order. Which takes some of the sting out off the price and you can get it on contract of course though I hate contract phones. I'm in no hurry for a new phone but I will consider this when I'm ready in the new year. By then it will be a reasonable price. I just hope they sort out the camera software by then. Has Sony ever said the official reason why they don't offer finger print sensor in US? It makes sense why a phone company would not sell a phone in certain countries it might not sell well, but to actually sell a phone with an entire hardware piece removed for just 1 region? Very Weird.  I don't see how thats beneficial to them in any way. Even if they make an extra $25 in profit on the phone, it makes them lose enough sales from people choosing phones with finger print sensors. They are probably losing more money than making because of that decision. They've never stated why but the guess is that someone owns the patent in the US for the way they do the fingerprint scanner and that person/company possibly wants lots of $$$ for use of it or for Sony to buy it. Since the US isn't a large market for Sony I guess they feel it just isn't worth the investment. Apparently the hardware is all there though and loading an international ROM on it will activate the fingerprint scanner but that's not something the average consumer wants to deal with. I have a Sony Xperia z3 from Sony. Don't get me wrong I totally love this phone and being a Sony fan with ps2,3,4 in my home and especially Sony psp series totally in love with Sony. Buy being true and honest my phone is not water proof,because I'm camera lens it received water when it's supposed to be water proof. I called T-Mobile and Sony company and all lied to me so many ways about the phone and the water bucket test in stores.(T-Mobile does not sell Sony phones any more-contract ended). Lies from Sony and especially when I explained the situation with phone they denied. Sorry Sony but  the people need to here and know don't believe the lies from them. If I am not believable then drop that new 700 dollar phone in water and let's see......water proof. Prove it SONY HONESTLY THIS TIME. I loved the three Xperia phones I used over the last four years. However their imaging is not top notch like some of their competitors as of late and no fingerprint scanner is a serious mistake. I almost feel like they are punishing the US market by not including it. I will wean myself off of Sony and try the smaller pixel phone next month. I hope I don't regret it. I don't know about you guys, but I'd prefer this over Note 7 or S7/edge, but still can't afford either though.  haha Well, we already know what to expect from Sony at this point in terms of price. Hey, look! An overpriced Sony, lacking in features, I'm shocked. I can't see myself buying a Sony product again, unless they really improve their software updating. Since I mentioned it, I just checked out Amazon UK pricing. 539.99 pounds is discounted to 533.32 plus 13.24 shipping (546.56 plus 0 VAT) minus an unnamed promotion applied of -83.33 yielding a final price of 463.23 pounds, which converts to approximately $600 US. Strictly from an economics standpoint you cannot make the initial price of a ""flag ship"" device low, because it will eventually over time be considered inferior.  Chinese phones have great paper spec's but lack the overall physical build quality and aesthetically pleasing user experiencing than other phones from Korea, Japan and USA (even though the iPhone is manufactured in China). Also, every business knows consumers will wait for a price point, so they will never start the price where consumers say they want i.  We all know tech gets less expensive over time and from an economics standpoint, we, consumers, the vast majority, will wait for a price point.  For example, most believe XZ too expensive at $699.  A fellow poster indicated specifically, $100 too expensive.  So if consumer wants this phone, for whatever reason they may, said consumer will wait until price drops $100.  If price started at $599, same consumer will probably buy at that price, but there will be x additional consumers, knowing tech always get less expensive, will wait for the price to drop $100.  Next set of consumers are waiting for the next $100 price drop and so on and so on.  Businesses will always start at ""flag ship"" price to get earliest adopters, ultimate fan boys/girls.  When those have purchased price will drop to get next level consumer; it's priced $100 too high.  And then drop price to get the next level consumer, etc.  Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG, Google all do this.  The exception to this is when they are trying to break into the business segment and gain market share; Chinese phone manufacturers, Google with the first Nexus phones/tablets. Personally, I am hoping the pre-order will include a free MDRXB950BT like in Europe.  Headset MSRP of $199.99 most times at street price of $129.99-$149.99, but can sometimes be had for $99.99.  Either way, I am getting phone day 1.  Currently phone is T-Mobile Z3 and I am beyond due for a phone upgrade.  Does XZ measure up in every way to Samsung?  I say no, but I cannot stand Korean electronics especially AMOLED screens and the over saturated colors.  Just my personal opinion, as I know lots of people love overly saturated colors on AMOLED screens on phones and the same overly saturated colors on their TV's.  All of my electronics except for the Comcast boxes are Japanese.  Weird thing is I cannot stand Japanese cars, but my daily commuter is a Genesis G80 and I love all the tech inside the car. What have you been smoking? Lol, exactly. What a weirdo.  ""Inferior Chinese Build Quality"". Where does be think ALL phones are made? Ok, not all, but 90% Who in !##&amp; does Sony think they are ? Ridiculous pricing for their phones.. For 699 I could buy an Axon and Honor 8. Almost... $699 for this? Ridiculous. I'd wait a while til the price goes down, then buy an international model that has the fingerprint reader. Why not?  Motorola and HTC also think they can charge these types of prices but wonder why they are in the red.   So $699 for a 5.2"" full HD flagship phone.  That is less that even Samsung charged for the S7 - which has a better display, camera, fingerprint sensor, and Samsung Pay.  I mean, really Sony?  At least Motorola has Moto Mods.  This phone should cost $499. They offer a compact phone that is nearly the same size as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Honor 8.  They get the performance right but do little things like not including a quick charge compatible charger in the box when they are already charging $499 for the phone.  No fingerprint sensor either.  Ok but not great camera.  Several other OEMs use Sony cameras and get better camera quality than Sony does...This phone is $100 too expensive. Keep it up Sony.  I don't know what is a bigger joke this week, this or Google's Allo. Fingerprint scanner? - nvm, i didn't read Geez Sony $699!
Clueless...thinking they have enough of a following to gouge today's buyers. Price will drop in under a month on Swappa lol Either this or the Pixel XL. Will be interesting to see how well received the Pixel phones are at a similar price. (without water resistance but with a fingerprint scanner) You can get a Galaxy S7 unlocked on Amazon for less than 600. Why would you pay that much for a lesser phone? Delusional Sony... Wow! The only thing I have to give Sony props for is how fast these phones will be become available for once. This is how it should be. Now if they would only get the pricing together... Poor  Sony. They really just don't get it. Exactly. This will flop I've always wanted one of the xperias, but they are always so expensive.  $700???  Give me a break.   I doubt it's better than my unlocked $400 Nexus 6p anyway I have the same doubt. $699? Hah...",Sony's new Xperia XZ hitting the U.S. for $699 on Oct 2

          Monday, Feb 27, 2017 at 2:45 am EST
         Sony continues to hit so many specs in a single phone. As is the case with each Sony release window, there's one phone that stands high above the rest. In early 2017, that's the Xperia XZ Premium, and as the name would suggest it comes with a few top-end specs inside. The XZ Premium differentiates itself internally with a 4K display, a new 19MP camera, a Snapdragon 835 processor and all of the other bells and whistles you expect from a flagship phone. Here's the complete spec sheet for the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. No FP sensor in the US will be a deal breaker for me, too bad. Root the phone, it's pretty simple to re-enable the feature. The screen will default to 1080 for normal use...I read it several times already. So only when 4K HDR content is in use will the screen go to 4K. Under normal use then with the new Snapdragon 835 battery should be great! Two things bother me...GLASS BACKS on phones is STUPID and I wish all the manufacturers would just STOP it!!! Who cares how premium it looks when you're forced to put a case on it? Not to mention scratches and fingerprints galore. My 2nd complaint is the 2.5 curved front screen! STOP IT!!!!!! This makes it impossible to get a properly fitting tempered glass screen protector! SO even though the LG G6 has a glass back also...the one redeeming thing is that it has a FLAT front screen which will accommodate a properly fitting tempered glass screen protector. Also, the previous Sony flagship could have the fingerprint scanner turned on very easily. Just go to XDA for the details. I am sure they will do the same for this phone so it's a non-issue. Decisions, decisions, decisions. Sony says it is 4k all the time, not like z5p Should this not have quick charge 4.0? Oh LG what a shame... No FPS for the US market.  F'ck off, Sony. Not their fault...they are being strongarmed by either the carriers or other manufacturers to disable (not remove) the feature in the US.  If it's THAT important to you, you can re-enable the scanner by rooting your phone! It's gorgeous, especially the mirrored finish. I really like the somewhat unique design of most Sony phones (although a little less bezel was probably needed this year), but the glass back and size aren't a good fit for me. I even like the power button and FPS combo a lot. It's a shame the FPS isn't officially included for the U.S. And it seems like OEMs are excluding more features from the U.S. this year, offering its best abroad. I hope Apple and Samsung's U.S. dominance doesn't result in fewer good options for American buyers. Looks quite nice but I wouldn't buy it if I was in the US without the fingerprint scanner.  Having tried the S7 this year though I will being going with the S8. The finger print scanner is there. Just not enabled. Just flash another ROM on it and it works. What's with Sony not offering a fingerprint sensor in the US? Ugh. That's one of the reasons why I'll never purchase a Sony phone. The guess is it's a patent issue but we don't know the exact reasons.  Guess is they don't want to spend the money on using or buying the patent. Also, the scanner is there but just disabled so you can flash a UK ROM on it, for example, and it will work. But that's a guess. Seems silly though. Lol no fingerprint sensor in the U.S. DOA. I've always wanted an xperia phone but the cost of them has always seemed sky high This sounds pretty good, I could see some market trends resulting from it. I only have one problem with Sony phones though, the edges hurt, when it stabs you in pocket, on a belt holder, etc,. Sony has to get away from those sharp corner designs. Is the 4K resolution the same as the Z5 Premium where the display was only 4K when you viewed 4K content and Full HD the rest of the time or is it actually 4K all of the time? Very nice! I hope it's on US carriers! &gt; Fingerprint sensor (except U.S.) What the... It was looking good until this line. I mean, really!? We still have to deal with this foolishness?? I know the UK has had to deal with this garbage as well. The best phone that no one will buy...
And the bezel king! Dang that's an ugly face ""and all of the other bells and whistles you expect from a flagship phone""  Except in 2017 I expect flagship cameras to have OIS.
This one is the same old sh*t as before from Sony. No OIS. Wonder will it be gimped in the US and what is MSRP gonna be Of course it will. No fingerprint sensor and it will be at least $799. Sony doesn't care about the US market. And we have to wait at least 3-4 months before the phone will go on sale. It's gimped for US consumers and it will be forgotten by most consumers by the time it is released. Great for you americans it is only 799..
In my country must be 1300 Watch it have terrible performance. Many website say it is a 4K Display.. No.
It is a 4K HDR display. What is going on with all the spam lately, and no way to report it? If they could get T-Mobile to carry this I would strongly consider using my upgrade for this. Seems very promising but I'm interested in seeing how it actually performs especially that camera. Make a XZ Premium Compact and I'll be interested Sony old boy. Seems like a nice phone, but super low battery and 4k screen probably 4k on demand but still, that sucks. Why they put such low battery in 2017? other companies can fit in more juicy battery, and the phone gonna need all the power it can get, another phone to skip... Wonder what US bands this will support 🤔??? Probably same or better than the last flagship they produced. Considering its using an 835, I would not be worried at all. 4K is total overkill for a smart phone. Good luck getting through one day of without charging your phone with that 4K resolution. Hell, 2K is almost too much. I set my S7 Edge display to the lowest resolution and haven't really noticed (I never use the free Gear VR I have). If the resolution is adjustable, then the 4K doesn't seem like an issue. And you'd want it if you are going to use the phone for VR. The s7 edge does a pretty good job at having great battery life with a 2k screen. &gt;4k screen
&gt;3200 mAh battery
Uhhhhhh 3230 mAh, not 3200 On the Z5 Premium, it was only 4k when accessing 4k content. It defaults to 1080p (I believe). So hopefully thistle do the same This is very interesting. Sonys problem in US always was marketing, if they sell it in all big 4, they will get bunch of them out the door.
It will be good year for Sony to get up some speed to, considering there's less big name flagships to compete with so far. LG is a flop, Nokia nothing yet, huawei will not sell on big 4, so forget about it, blackberry is a niche market. With all that, we are left with SGS8, note8, V30 and that's all I can think of right now. If there ever was a real chance for Sony, it is now. Exactly... I really hope they do sell it on US carriers. They could do really good if they did. Pixel Audio Output: Good? Any DAC? Batterylife: 24hours, no matter what i do? ( got used to it) Dual-Sim: is it there ,if yes: only hybrid? Memory Card: yes or no If 4 times yes, interested. Otherwise have to look for a V20 , checks all the Boxes plus removable battery,  which is this Sony also lacking. Very hard nowadays, not many manufacturers doing it right, even the new LG G6 suc.ks monkey balls. I know there is LDAC when you use earphones.
Hi Res Audio
Xperia can performe upscale on audio files. I thought LG didn't put an 835 cause they couldn't put it out quick enough when's this officially releasing? Do you trust what they say? The 835 is much more expensive,  LG can't put out a low price tag (at least below 599) , they have to cut costs somewhere. Of course it was possible for LG to release the G6 with the 835. It seems G6 is goint to be US$ 800 in South Korea Well they're not lying. Sony will only ship this one in a couple of months. That's why they could put it Will buy two. Finally I can park my two HARO  BMX  oldschool bikes on smartphone bezels. Haha... This is actually looking like a great device and I'm still really more of a fan of Sony's hardware design. Any news on a Sony smartwatch 4?? I'm waiting for it, too! What a beast! Mmmmmmm, specs...... ●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩GIVE IT FEW MINUTES۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬● &lt;a href=""h""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

" Big money Standard Sony Roundup Well that's convoluted Top of the top  Order Samsung Galaxy S8: AT&amp;T |  Verizon | T-Mobile | Sprint | Unlocked at Best Buy  By             Daniel Bader
            
          Monday, Feb 27, 2017 at 2:45 am EST
         A big, beautiful new phone, but it may not be worth the price. Sony's latest flagship is the Xperia XZ Premium, and it's really nice. It's one of those phones you don't want to touch because it's so nice to look at. You may also not want to touch it because the damn thing is incredibly shiny, exposing fingerprints as well as any mirror. And it may not be worth buying because, well, there are just better devices out there at a lower price. Interested in this phone? Here are a few things you need to know about Sony's best phone ever. Sony debuted the 4K smartphone in 2015 with the Xperia Z5 Premium, and this year's follow-up has a better, brighter 5.5-inch 4K panel with a trick up its sleeve: HDR support. Content that supports HDR — High Dynamic Range — will look more vivid and colorful on the XZ Premium's 4K display. Let's just hope that Netflix updates its app to support the Premium's setup because we need some of that streaming goodness on here.  Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 is one of the most anticipated updates to phone chips in a long time. Faster, more efficient, with better support for VR, high-speed LTE, and smarter cameras, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium may be only the second device to launch with the chip after the Samsung Galaxy S8. A phone with a 4K needs a powerful SoC inside. The Xperia Z5 Premium was powered by the troubled Snapdragon 810, and while it didn't have performance problems, it also didn't upscale a lot of content. Sony says that this year's follow-up will take it upon itself to do just that, and that's mainly because the Snapdragon 835 can take the hit without affecting the battery too harshly.  People don't buy phones; they buy cameras that connect to the internet. Sony understands this, and has designed its devices around the camera experience for years. But as much as it's tried to outdo the likes of Samsung, LG and Apple, it continues to come up short. Sony thinks the XZ Premium has what it takes to beat the competition in 2017 with a new ""Motion Eye"" camera setup that lowers the resolution from 23 megapixels to 19 while increasing the size of the individual pixels, ensuring improved low-light results. At the same time, a new connection between the camera sensor and the phone's memory allows for caching of photos — predictive capture, as it's called — five times faster than any previous Sony phone, so no frames are lost during quick-shutter action shots. That same new setup also allows for the new 960fps slow motion mode, which looks to deliver outstanding results. I can't wait to use this.  Seriously, this is the most reflective phone I've ever seen. The Luminous Chrome variant is the worst offender, offering an easily-tarnished mirror finish that shows off every fingerprint. As long as you're not too particular, and walk around with a microfiber cloth in your bag or pocket, the Xperia XZ Premium could stay pristine, but it's likely to pick up hairline scratches pretty quickly — a problem with all phones, but exacerbated by the reflectiveness of the Gorilla Glass 5.  Seriously Sony, this is getting ridiculous. While the company won't divulge the reason for the feature's continued omission in its most underserved market, we're getting a little tired. This is an essential feature, both for security and convenience, and the longer we go without it, the less likely we are to recommend phones. Especially one that's likely approaching $900.  Like most Sony phones of the last few years, the Xperia XZ Premium is IP68 water resistant and dustproof. The ratings mean you can submerge the phone in up to one meter for an extended period without incurring damage. And, of course, there are no port covers to worry about.  We may be beyond it by the time the phone is released in late spring — late May, early June — the Xperia XZ is currently certified for Android 7.1.1 Nougat, which means that it will support all the latest goodies from Google, including rounded icons, image keyboards, and more. Sony's skin continues to be very light and very fast, and there's no question that the company has learned its lesson in deviating too far from Google's recommendations. This isn't Samsung; Sony doesn't have the customer loyalty, nor the resources, to develop great custom skins, so the more it keeps to Google's Android the better. Indeed, the new launcher has Google Now to the left of the main home screen, a result of the deprecation of the Google Now Launcher and opening that feature up to manufacturers. Great to see Sony implementing it so quickly.  Right now, the Xperia XZ Premium is coming to the U.S. in ""late spring,"" according to Sony, and it has no explicit price or U.S. carrier partners. Indeed, we've been told the phone won't be sold at U.S. carriers, but will instead be offered unlocked on Amazon. That's all well and good, but based on the smaller Xperia XZs's price of $699.99, it's easy to see this phone approaching $900. Whether people will be willing to spend that much on a large, shiny 4K phone remains to be seen.  Yup. Insane. It may only be 720p, but think about the constrast between a regular 30fps capture and something as smooth as 960fps, slowed down to look great on this big, beautiful screen. I'm drooling just thinking about it.  And then I consider buying one. Just think about the phone market right now. It's chock full of unbelievably powerful, well-made phones delivering on promises of innovation year after year. Sony may be unveiling the Xperia XZ Premium before Samsung's Galaxy S8, but it's almost certainly going to be available well afterwards — well after Samsung has sucked up all the air in the proverbial room and convinced millions of customers to upgrade, including many Sony Xperia users. Sony is in a tough position. It knows it makes good phones, but it also understands that its strategy of consistent iterative updates leaves some people cold; it's more akin to an annual car refresh than a big-time reveal. The Xperia XZ Premium is likely a great phone — it's certainly striking, and quite attractive — but there's no way the camera will be as good as the Galaxy S8's, nor its battery as long-lasting as the Huawei Mate 9. With a price almost certainly approaching $900, and no fingerprint sensor in the U.S., you may want to give this one a pass. I rather like  the phone. and the fingerprint scanner thing would not sway me if the device is good looking fast and takes a good photo yea.reviews are getting very biases like the nightly news. I want to know things like performance and camera quality and call quality not what the writer likes or dislikes because they don't care for sony  just the pure facts so I can make up my own mind on the merits of not having a fingerprint scanner. Honestly, I'd probably buy a Sony phone over Samsung if they'd just market here in the US. IDK why they don't. It's insane to me. The world's largest consumer market and they choose to stay away. Odd. Very odd indeed. It is, and because of our AC reviewer and more like him people wont even actually test the phone for themselves, they would just pass on it. And just like Sony lost the VAIO battle, the Bravia battle, one day there won't be no Xperia and no Playstation left. This will definitely be my 4th Sony phone. My very 1st was a Sony Ericsson (AT&amp;T), then the Z (T-Mobile) and currently the Z3 (T-Mobile). Top &amp; bottom bezels, not an issue for me as it me somewhere to put my thumbs when holding the device in landscape mode while playing Real Racing 3 &amp; watching movies on planes. Fingerprint scanner, would it be nice if I didn't have to flash the device to get it to work in the US? Yes, of course it would. Will I do that? No. Reason being I do not really care if the fingerprint scanner works or not. Not that i plan on being stopped and searched by police, but I cannot be compelled to provide unlock gesture or pin. I can be compelled to provide fingerprint. Fingerprint scanner super convenient, but not at all secure. Camera - For my eyes, I do not like the over saturated colors of a Samsung. Nor do I use a phone as my primary camera. If the intent is to post to Facebook, Instagram, etc., virtually any smart phone with a camera takes a good enough picture for posting. If my intent, as in most of the camera shoot-out tests, is to zoom into the pixel level or capture RAW photos, I use an actual camera. So this device checks, for me all the write boxes, it's an iPhone, it's not Samsung and it has high-end specs. BTW, even though I love Sony products, I am not overly biased. Got the wife ZTE Axon 7 for Christmas (upgraded from HTC M8, she also use iPhone 6 for work), daughter has LG G4 (upgraded from Galaxy something) and son has ZTE Axon 7 mini (upgraded from Motorola G3). Realizing Sony does not sell well in the US (I know that's an understatement), but it does make money (or at least breaks even) in Japan, Europe, India and Africa. I fully believe Sony continues to make phones not as a way to make a huge profit in their mobile division, but as a ""proof of concept"" to showcase their latest efforts in R&amp;D; specifically, the display panel and the camera lens. I have not kept up with how many manufacturers still use Sony display panels, but it's not an insignificant number. Also how many phone manufacturers use Sony's CMOS lens. Again, i don't have an exact count, but it's not an insignificant number. Would Sony like to make a bunch of profit from selling phones? Yes. But I fully believe they are protecting balance sheets of display and camera divisions by putting R&amp;D costs in mobile. Basically a loss leader to help ensure they make continued profits in display and camera division. Agreed plus from what I've seen Sony has it priced competitively so this will be mine for sure https://www.clove.co.uk/sony-xperia-xz-premium I want the chrome one. Not worried about fingerprints as it will be in a case. https://www.sonymobile.com/us/products/accessories/style-cover-stand-scs... LOL. Upgraded from Galaxy something? Sheesh. Don't like Samsung much? Ignorance must be bliss indeed. I believe I started not overly biased. And I listed a few of the myriad phones I have recently purchased for my family. Samsung TVs &amp; audio/visual components, yes I don't like Samsung. Their phones, I'm not a fan of the panels or TouchWiz. Other add-ons, such as it's scanner &amp; gear VR are pretty cool. In any event, I used Galaxy something phrasing because I don't recall if the last phone I got my daughter was a 3 &amp; she purchased the 4 or I purchased the 4 &amp; she purchased the 5. Are these articles written in vaccums with no editorial oversight for content? ""People don't buy phones; they buy cameras that connect to the internet."" This is the problem. These are still phones and overall computing tools. I rarely use my camera for anything meaningful. Tell that to my 14 year old daughter who uses Instagram and Snapchat constantly.  Nose in phone syndrome. Sounded like Sony might finally be able to compete with the Top 5 smartphones for 2017 until the no finger print scanner.  I don't know about other people, but once I got a phone with a fingerprint scanner (especially where LG puts there's perfectly on the back), I can't go back to not having one.  It trumps almost all phone features for me. Sony's representatives at MWC were pressed hard on the print reader issue and reluctantly responded that it was US carriers who forced them to disable it stateside. Basically, ATT and Verizon are up to their usual BS, because they hate it when companies like Samsung and Apple can dictate terms to them instead of the other way around. It was likely a choice between carrier exclusitivity with a scanner or both carriers without. By not having the critical feature, the carriers keep the phone too weak to become the next Galaxy/iPhone. I would gladly pay 650 for this phone.  The fingerprint sensor isn't a deal breaker. It's a fine looking phone. And it just depends how the camera stacks up.  Oh and the price. Fingerprint scanners mean nothing to me. Too many Big Brother kind of risks associated with them for my taste. So the Sony may work great for me. Especially since I love its cameras and own two of them, At times like this, I am really glad to be in Europe. As someone mentioned, one could see Sony's commercial a lot here. A lot of electronics retailers has stand-alone ""Sony"" section, smartphones included, and it was several time that the ""Sony smartphones"" shelve was more visible then those of Samsung or Apple... Anyway, if they will do everything right, I'm going for this one for sure. Design is pretty subjective thing, I know a lot of people doesn't like it, but be it. After all, when you buy a phone, you buy it for yourself, not for everyone else. So even though those bezels, I still feel it's kind of original and simply Sony design, which I like. I thought that with Xperia Z5 Premium, their designer went asleep as it was their latest phone which attracted me the most (after Xperia Z2). It's only shame that they didn't learn from Z5P in terms of content. It's good they offered Amazon Prime, but what about the other things? They could have cooperated with Google on Daydream platform, to access it in true 4K, the same with YouTube, as VR is the only thing where this phone's potential may be driven to its fullest... Forgoing the inclusion of the fingerprint sensor is ridiculous; all major android flagships right now are lacking key features: Pixel - IP68 waterproofing
S7 - USB-C
G6 - OLED, quad dac/wireless charging
XZ - fingerprint sensor (seriously sony?)
HTC U Ultra - decent battery Honestly, the Huawei P10 looks pretty good at this point... The G6 has wireless charging I'd argue that the V20 is still the best all around phone on the market, especially at the discounted prices.  It was recently on sale for $360 on T-Mobile and there isn't a better phone on the market for $360.  The only thing ""missing"" is IP68 water resistance. Honestly Android central and most US tech sites bash Sony for no good reason the fingerprint sensor is there and it can work by flashing firmware from anywhere in the world and no it doesn't void warranty. Yes it's not the best way after paying for a device but the journalist here need to up their game after all they did state the reason why it's disabled so why turn around in another article and make it a big deal??? Actually, I Googled it and apparently missing fingerprint sensor is not Sony's fault. Some contract forbid them to sell phones in US with working fingerprint sensor. So States ****** things up. And about wireless charging, it's just shiny feature, that's not actually useful, what, now we are so lazy, that we can't plug port in our phone. And the second you move your phone from that exact position where it is charging wirelessly, charging stops. When you charge your phone with usb cable, at least you can use it however you want. It would definitely be useful if u could enter the room or some smaller area and just be asked if you want your phone to start charging. That would be wireless charging that would be useful af. I bet all tech websites are going to keep using 8mp to take photo.
If they do not feel satisfied, why not use 23? People...please...the last Sony flagship could easily have the fingerprint reader enabled. Just go to XDA and you can find the details. I am fairly certain that the same will be done on this phone. The hardware is there and even though Sony ""cannot"" enable it themselves...that does not stop others from doing so. Therefore, do not let the fingerprint scanner be the deciding factor. I don't get why I wouldn't be interested in this, other than the allegation of a $900 price tag (that's well beyond reasonable for a phone, IMO). I'm not buying anything from Samsung, their design and general approach to phones does not impress me. They're like every other behemoth, more of a safe-playing disappointment. They're Apple. They're Intel. What they do is pretty darned polish, but also incredibly boring and predictable. The alternatives are far from great, to boot. Huwaei won't bring its flagship to the U.S. LG went super safe and lame with its G6. HTC is nowhere to be found. Motorola and Nokia decided to stay in the low-end. BlackBerry's doing something weird in the mid-range. Basically, Sony's the only one that is showing me a flagship that is visually solid (minus that horrendous presence of a glass back--I hoped that died 5 years ago...), and seems to hit all of the flagship marks; well, except wireless charging. This thing's more expensive than I would go after, but I will at least keep an eye out at what all Sony launches more around the $500-600 range. Everyone else is either not releasing a flagship, not releasing ANYTHING in the US, or being incredibly unimpressive. What I want to know is why is it limited to four apps wide? Super high res screen and it's still a 4x grid. There are a few big phones (like the Note7) that make the grid 5x and it looks so much better. Even more obvious when the app launcher bit at the bottom has 5 apps on it. That and, why such a long lead time Sony? By the time it's actually available for purchase most of us will already have a different phone and no longer be interested :( LMAO, no fingerprint scanner in the US, again.  F'ck off, Sony. on the XZ it was easy to get around. not an issue. still, it's a puzzlement as to why they continue to disable it. They have to due to a likely contract dispute Actually, I Googled it and apparently missing fingerprint sensor is not Sony's fault. Some contract forbid them to sell phones in US with working fingerprint sensor. So States ****** up Well, at least ""... but it may not be worth the price"" is a step in the right direction from their last few flagships, which were absolutely, definitely, hilariously not worth the price. So they've got that going for themselves, I guess. Good phone, no fingerprint sensor in the US, no thanks Sony.
To the people who say, you can flash the European firmware and get the fingerprint sensor, no I'm not paying $700 and up and flash a different country firmware to get a fingerprint sensor working. Looking good!  Still trying to decide if the chrome on the front looks good, but I'll need to see more videos to form a full opinion.  Hoping enabling the fingerprint scanner on the U.S. version will be as straightforward as prior models.  I'll definitely be grabbing this phone.  My Z5 Premium is still my absolute favorite Android phone.  Chrome is such an amazing ""color."" I want to ""want"" this phone, but no fingerprint sensor in 2017 is just ridiculous. The cheapest $200 phones can figure out a way to have this implemented and Sony can't? I Googled it and apparently missing fingerprint sensor is not Sony's fault. Some contract forbid them to sell phones in US with working fingerprint sensor. Love my x performance just wish it has less bezel and larger battery. Other than that it's been fantastic. Upgraded from z3c last year when it came out I want these specs but not a 5.5 if Sony got their bezels right maybe 5.2 if not give me another 5"" Thinking about snagging a Xperia XZ, now that the prices have come way down. Problem is SD820 is slow compared to A10X, 835, Kirin 960 I jumped from the Sony Z3 to my current LG5 and hate most things about the jump. Actually I just hate one thing. I HATE LGs software. Especially there phone and contacts app. And it's the one thing you can't really replace (dialers are nice but I have yet to find one that I like as much as Sony's).  That said, I do like LGs hardware and the fact that Sony has decided and that Samsung is forgoing that ugly and unnecessarily button is likely to have me buy my first Samsung this year, although the rebel in me still gets irritated by people who think that Samsung makes the only Android phone. Hmmm.... I wonder what HTC is up to this year... Sony has simply ceded the US market to Samsung and Apple and doesn't even try here anymore.  A shame because if more people saw one first hand (no pun intended) I think it is a phone that a lot of US customers would actually love having. Well together Sammy an apple have over 70%of the us market it's a wrap . Why waste the add dollars Lot of US customers are not informed on the latest phones and buy whatever the carrier rep sells. Even if it's loaded with the crappy carrier firmware it doesn't matter, atleast with iPhones they are getting quality device and not carrier crap. Thank god for Pixel and other unlocked options free from carrier we have some options on Android as well. Actually, I researched a bit about missing fingerprint sensor on Xperias, and apparently it is not Sony's fault. Some contract between US and Japan simply forbid them to sell phones in US with working fingerprint sensor. So States ****** things up. No fingerprint scanner for the US AGAIN Not correct. Actually, I researched a bit about missing fingerprint sensor on Xperias, and apparently it is not Sony's fault. Some contract between US and Japan simply forbid them to sell phones in US with working fingerprint sensor. So States ****** things up. And you can enable fingerprint sensor, it's just they can't enable it for you. So before you start hating, do homework first.. I've enjoyed most of the Sony phones that I've owned. I look forward to trying these new devices. Sony may not do much marketing in the US market. But here in Europe I see Sony commercials etc..We will see how it will be this time. The people that run Sony love mirroless cameras ,audio , television even headphones. But in my opinion that don't seem to care are they just don't know what to do with cell phones. They don't no jack S**"" about how to market them ,spec them are name them after all these years it's crazy from a company this big . Z5 and Z5P were 100 dollars different. This one may be no more than 830.
S8+ may reach 1000,00 dollars I guess it is worth Sony just doesn't get it when it comes to the US market. Give us the phone that we deserve Sony! Actually, I researched a bit about missing fingerprint sensor on Xperias, and apparently it is not Sony's fault. Some contract between US and Japan simply forbid them to sell phones in US with working fingerprint sensor. So States ****** things up. Sony is back. This is the first Sony phone in a long while that has me intrigued. It'll need to seriously impress me to finally dethrone the Z3, though. The Z3 was great...Moved up to a Z5 which was a disappointing, then to the S7 which is a great phone. But, I've always been a Sony fan and this looks good enough so far to be my next phone. Hope so! Man, same phone combination as myself. Z3, Z5 and now S7 , and I am looking towards another Sony. Peace bro. I really like the look of this phone. Have the G5 at the moment and due an upgrade in sept but I'm now torn between this and the G6 for me both look great phones. The wide angle camera on the g6 is what is turning me that way through as I love it on the G5.",Top 10 things to know about the Sony Xperia XZ Premium

         Sony has a new phone out tomorrow, but you may want to wait for the real upgrade. Sony makes a lot of phones, and many of them aren't particularly noteworthy in the U.S. Thanks to a long-term contract with Verizon that isn't set to expire until next year, Sony can't sell phones with fingerprint sensors in the country, making them more of a difficult proposition than they otherwise would be.  This week, the Xperia XZs is going on sale at Amazon and other online retailers for $700, a steep price to pay for any phone, never mind one that doesn't include the latest and greatest technology. The XZs was one of four phones that company announced during MWC 2017, and while it is an impressive handset in every way, it doesn't stand up to the competition. Sony Xperia XZs specs The phone is, for all intents and purposes, a repackaging of the Xperia XZ released in September, swapping out the 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage for 4GB and 64GB, respectively. It also has a Snapdragon 820 processor, which is unchanged from the XZ, along with a 2,900mAh battery. The major difference, aside from the bump in memory, is the new 19MP Motion Eye camera, which reportedly brings a new camera sensor that's better in low light and faster to autofocus. For $700, the above sounds like a pretty lousy deal, especially with no fingerprint sensor. Sure, Sony's got some great software in there — the phone ships with Android 7.1.1 Nougat — but if you're really into the whole ""I need a Sony"" thing, you can get your fix in a couple of months with the gorgeous, far-more-impressive Xperia XZ Premium, which bumps up the spec sheet considerably, sporting a 4K HDR-ready display and a Snapdragon 835 platform. If you're not into waiting, though, you can get the Xperia XZs starting April 5 at Amazon. See at Amazon No fingerprint sensor for whatever reason.. No buy. Reflash Intl official rom from Sony, good to go. The hardware is there, just can't sell it thru official channel. How come they can't sell it with the fingerprint sensor activated? Something about some deal they made which is stupid.. It's going to expire soon and they'll be able to sell it with the sensor enabled. Those darn Verizon contacts... *Joke* Happy Tuesday all! I will seriously consider a Sony phone... Next year I hope makes the Pixel in 2018 That would be fantastic. I know Sony gets a lot of crap for their chunky bezels, but I absolutely love their design aesthetic and I've been really happy with the build quality of the Sony devices I've used. I'm sure Google is more concerned with consistency of style with the Pixel line than they were with the Nexus line, though, so I'll bet they stick with HTC as their manufacturer. I really want to check out a XZ Premium in person. Do you know if Bell Canada will sell them? They've been pretty supportive of Sony in the past. I hope they do sell ""impressive""? This is just a XZ 1.5.
It had a new SoC and a new camera (which will be as bad as the one on the XZ). And the Premium isn't worth it either, really. Sony phones are currently lacking too much to justify their prices. Best Buy is going to sell them in store, I'm not sure they're going to sell them in their stores in Canada. The weird thing is here in Europe, I can pick it up for like $525 (adjusted). Don't know why they price it that outrageously in the US. I mean I'm even struggling to justify paying over $500 for it. If it was $400-450 it might be worth it. Note: it's not the dual SIM version so it's only got 32 GB of eMMC storage. I loved Sony phones in the past but they just do too many weird things that I just can't justify the money. SD 820 for that price!?  No thank you! I hope  Bell sells  XZ premium and if they do, I would considering getting one The no fingerprint sensor is a deal breaker here. I can't go back. Also, battery is meh, and price is too high.... And, it's a Sony. No gracias. Leadership was so dumb to get themselves in a position where a contract dictated they couldn't have a fingerprint sensor.  I love sony phones.  Still have my z3 compact.  But until they get fingerprint sensors I can't buy one.  Definitely a deal breaker to have to type in a code to unlock your phone vs the ease of fingerprint usage.  Sucks because they have made some good phones over the last few years. I guess we wait until 2018 when they can include it. Dumb Verizon deal (but typical of Verizon strong-arming an OEM).  That said, I really don't care about a fingerprint reader.  It is worth the tradeoff for me to have a physical camera shutter button. I've had a Z3 Compact for 3 years now and can't imagine going to any other brand of phone now. I have that new phone bug right now and I really want to try a Sony phone but can't get myself to switch for the cost. Was looking at just the Xzs but for $700 no way.  I'll try to hold out a bit and see what the Premium offers. Also might wait and see what Nokia phones come out soon","Sony's impressive Xperia XZs is available Apr. 5, but you should wait for the Premium"

         Internally, not a whole lot has changed here. Taking one step down the ladder from the Xperia XZ Premium, we have the Xperia XZs — a mid-cycle refresh of last year's Xperia XZ with the same type of body and a few key changes to the specs. You'll see a new camera on board here, as well as an extra gigabyte of RAM ... the rest is pretty much unchanged.

Why do US consumers not get fingerprint sensors? I think there's something about patent issues. They've got itching fingers I prefer this size, but I want the look/design of the Premium. Yet another boring but sorta lovely rectangle slab to criticise Gee, I'm shocked, no FPS for the US market, again.  F'ck off, Sony. Strange setup with the 820, I don't quite get that pick. Also, no pricing/availability info? yep. why they didn't take this opportunity to update with the SD 821 seems odd. seems like a logical step to take. I would have considered upgrading my XZ to this if they had. I am a little bit skeptic, but the time will show. The specs are satisfying, love the Snarpdragon 820 and don't mind the battery capacity, we'll see about the durability.","Sony Xperia XZs specs: 5.2-inch 1080p display, 19MP camera, 2900 mAh battery"

         Sony just keeps doing its thing, launching high-end phones with ultra-high prices. Coming in pretty close to initial leaks, Sony has announced that its ultra-high-end flagship Xperia XZ Premium will launch in the U.S. unlocked on June 12 with an unsurprisingly high price of $799. There will be one week of pre-orders from Amazon and Best Buy before it fully launches on June 19.  Even though it's been over three months since Sony announced the new flagship — and therefore flagships from Samsung, LG, HTC and more have since launched — it still has an impressive spec sheet. If you're willing to drop the cash, the Xperia XZ Premium is offering a Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage (plus SD card), a 3230mAh battery, IP68 waterproofing and of course that ridiculously dense 5.5-inch 4K display. The XZ Premium also has a new 19MP camera with 960 fps slow-motion video. More: Complete Sony Xperia XZ Premium specs Big money gets you a whole lot of specs, but still not a fingerprint sensor. Despite its high-end price, the frustration of not having a fingerprint sensor in the U.S. version of Sony phones continues with the XZ Premium. It's pretty much inexcusable at this point, but as previously discussed this is likely a contractual issue that Sony is stuck with for the time being. Considering that the near-identical phone is on sale in the UK and Europe with a fingerprint sensor, we're likely looking at the same sort of situation as previous Xperia phones where the fingerprint hardware is there and Sony is disabling it in software. For all of the quirks of Sony's U.S. phone strategy, it has managed to figure out distribution properly. The Xperia XZ Premium will be available from all of the big electronics retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Fry's and more starting on June 12. See at Sony Press release: Sony Mobile Communications (""Sony Mobile"") is pleased to announce that Xperia XZ Premium will be available for pre-order on Amazon and Best Buy beginning June 12, 2017 and can be purchased unlocked starting June 19, 2017 in the United States through Amazon, Best Buy, Fry's and other participating retailers for a suggested retail price of $799.99. In addition, Sony Mobile's mid-tier Xperia XA1 Ultra pre-sales will start June 12, 2017 and will be available online on June 21 and in-stores on July 2. The long-awaited Xperia Touch will also be exclusively available at the Sony Square display room at 25 Madison Ave in New York City for a suggested retail price of $1,699.99. Pre-sales for Xperia Touch will begin on June 16. As Sony's newest flagship smartphone, Xperia XZ Premium builds on decades of Sony's camera innovation and draws on the heritage of the Sony Cyber-shot® range of cameras. Xperia XZ Premium features the new memory-stacked Motion Eye™ image sensor bringing several new technical features to users looking for the ultimate camera experience. Featuring a 19MP main camera and 13MP front-facing camera, Xperia XZ Premium captures the world in stunning quality. Xperia XZ Premium's camera provides the world's first super slow motion camera in a smartphone recording at 960 frames per second with playback 4X slower than other smartphones, making the ordinary look extraordinary.[i]  Furthermore, Motion Eye™ brings better low-light performance and higher optical clarity for sharper images and less noise. The Sony Exmor RS™ lens captures every little detail in stunning clarity by automatically adjusting the light levels internally and giving you a vibrant picture whether you're shooting in a full light setting or at night. Xperia XZ Premium also features the world's first 4K High Dynamic Range (HDR) screen in a smartphone which gives expanded light and colors, gives more depth to photos with the added pixels and shares a wider range of colors and tones than standard dynamic range content.[ii] Paired with 5.5"" 4K HDR TRILUMINOUS™ display technology, it gives users a sense of reality like never before. Xperia XZ Premium is packed with the newest Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 835 processor allowing for great connectivity and excellent entertainment whether creating super slow motion videos, watching 4K HDR videos, or playing the latest PlayStation® games on PS4™ Remote Play. Beyond camera and video capabilities, Xperia XZ Premium features Qnovo Adaptive Charging to support long-lasting battery life, along with a loop surface design leveraging Corning® Gorilla® Glass 5 on the front and back for added durability and water-resistant IP rating 65/68. The Xperia XZ Premium will be available in three colors: Luminous Chrome, Deepsea Black, and Bronze Pink, and will support GSM networks.

Might wait for the American version to go on sale though. Only hardcore Sony fans will buy this of which there are very few, and they'll continue losing money. It may even be a bigger fail as most high end Samsung and iPhone buyers won't be tempted. What a silly CONtract to sign. What an OVERpriced device. Why are they still here - I know why...they figured out that charging a body, to a niche market gives them a healthy ROE - why else are they releasing the same device aesthetically basically year upon year, cause' someone is buying them LOL....and this fingerprint lack...who is the contract with, I skimmed the article hyperlinked didn't catch it, but it can't purely be marketing or something whoever this "" agreement"" is with, has to be benefiting from their lack of presence AND had a legit reason to prohibit them selling here with them !! Fear not USA, the XZ Premium will sell well in the rest of the world. Meh I'm good with my s8+ until the Note 8 comes out. Maybe for $599.99, but I'd still rather get a different phone.  Besides carrier payment plans are how most people in the US buy phones, I don't have the money for a flagship lying around and saving up for it, I'm likely to buy something more practical and useful than another new phone lol. Only recently started using Sony as my Moto G5 was stolen and that was only to replace my S7 which died of ""not paying that to replace a screen"". Started with z1 compact, great, then z3 compact, amazing, best small phone ever, and now I am on an xperia X, despite the mediocre reviews I am loving it, hasn't let me down once, and gaming buttery smooth. So I am very very interested in the new Sony phone, specs are always top notch, ok design never changes much but in the UK they certainly give you bang for your buck. And playing my PS4 on it when the wife is watching telly, genius. Have one arriving tomorrow. Bought it from the UK. So it is in English, has the warranty, fingerprint sensor will work, am getting an external bluetooth speaker as a promotional gift, and best of all it only cost me $676.63 US. No tax and a $100.00 speaker brings the total price down to $576.6s shipped. People need to learn how to wheel and deal. Not too hard if you try. Dang that's a good deal. Care to share where you bought it from? Awesome! Let us know how it is! People are too lazy to look around and find a good deal. Also the US seems to want to FINANCE everything. Yeah it's 0 percent but it locks you into that carrier, or you have to pay full price if you leave the carrier, which is actually more than you can get it outright off the web or elsewhere.  US household debt non mortgage, is aorund $17000. That's crazy. Anyway if you never used a sony you can't say much. To each their own. I am using the Xzs and it's is a thousand times better than my old samsung. They hold up great with all the other competition in speed test and everything. In my mind I don't care if I have edge to edge or not. Does not bother me one bit. That's just a personal feeling though. Tempted to buy but too many phones already pre-ordered (U11 and Essential). I think I'll pass on this one. Somebody. Anybody. Buy it and let me know how you like it.😂😂 $799?
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha UK and Europe???
I know it's an island and it goes through the Brexit and all, but I thought UK was in Europe (until further notice, don't they hold an European Union passport?).
Is UK a geographical area all by itself? At least Sony knows that UK is in Europe as they treat them the same! Perhaps it's a different region when it comes tofirmware revisions. Either way it's a pointless discussion. The UK normally gets things before the rest of Europe since it speaks English unlike the rest of Europe. That's why that differentiation is normally made. Good luck with that strategy Sony.. I have lost faith with Sony phones. I'm still holding on to my Z3 Compact because of the battery life and easy to use with one hand. But newer Sony phones don't offer that kind of battery life anymore. And the camera sucks. Yeah, just like the reviews from any tech sites. ""if you're willing to drop the cash” Ah no we're not willing. Sony can take a dump on this. Then they wonder why the smartphone division is failing. This right here is a big reason. Yup. The fact that it's not available, again, through carriers shows that they don't know how us consumers purchase phones mostly... By walking into a carrier store and purchasing through (likely) some payment plan. They there is no fingerprint, and to top it all off you have like 30% bezels and a 4k screen with a small battery. I have zero interest in this phone at this point. Haven't bought a sony phone in many many many years either. It's a year out of date.
You've got to go edge to edge now if you are making a premium phone. For me, the killer features are:
1) the 807 ppi!. I will use this device as my main device but also for VR. 807 ppi greatly reduce the ""Screen Door Effect"" where you see the grid between the pixels magnified by the VR headset... the larger the pixels, the more apparent is the grid !.
2) the camera. I have an excellent Sony DSLR and their camera sensors and software are excellent. Also, 960 fps is going to be fun to play with.
3): Snapdragon 835 + 4GB + 64GB of UFS memory (3 x faster than traditional eMMC memory) = superfast phone. Sure I would like an edge to edge screen, but the bezels size is secondary to me. They may be less ""sexy/trendy"" than the current bezel-less phones, but I don't mind... I am in the UK and mine is arriving on Friday 2nd ! can't wait... I agree. Its edge to edge or nothing at this point. Even the Essential phone is to little of an innovation (that camera syphilis is really gross). Hoping the Note 8 handles the slim bezels much better. Also.. Any company who outs a phone with decent sized top/bottom bezels and calls their device ""bezel-less"" is officially DOA, and will 100% lose respect from those who aspire to have a bezel-less phone. So if you work for a company and notice them doing this, step up and do something about it before its too late. Umm no you don't have to be like everyone else just to make a premium phone. We don't need every OEM copyong each other just for the sake of fitting in. But Sony does need to cut out those bezel and for goodness sake try to get the price down for an unlocked phone surrounded by more easily accessible and arguably better competitors. DOA already with no biometric security in the US. Hardly.  It's DOA for a number of reasons, a finger print reader probably isn't at the top of the list. I personally don't use one (FPR), but when you combine the fact it's not available at carriers, lack of advertising and more of the same.. your left with enthusiasts, like us, who have a lot more market choice then your average consumer.  And I love Sony!  My tablet and cell phone (up to 3 weeks or so ago) were both Sony, and the second they trim those bezels I'm back on it, bio-metrics or not. I wish I knew what the specific details are. Incredible to think that a ZTE phone has something a Sony phone doesn't. Sony phones are like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Big on production but the finished product is always lacking something. 100% agree. Since they still offer fingerprint sensor in other regions, it strikes me they are merely trying to continue their cost savings by not paying licensing fees. If they are selling a low cost budget phone, that's one thing. At this cost, there is no excuse. Further, it opens the door to the question, ""where else did they skimp on costs?"" Still getting in their own way, I guess. Search the web, apparently the fingerprint reader IS present in the Xperia phones but disabled by firmware for US versions. This is due to ""external factors"" (patent / contractual obligations) in the US... In short, Sony was told that if they wanted to continue to do business in the US they had to make the ""business decision"" not to include the fingerprint sensor!!! (told by who???)
See: https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-fingerprint-sensors-us-deals Some Android sites explain how this can be re-enabled by the users. That was certainly the case with the XZ (https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/6/13185504/xperia-xz-x-c... Therefore nothing to do with ""cost saving"", as it will probably cost more to have to manufacture 2 different versions rather than simply one and disabling the sensor by flashing a US specific firmware at the end of the production line!
This purely due to how business is done in the US! I have finger print reader on my Sony Experia Z5 Premium and it is flawless and convenient. Of course I had to import it via Amazon. The other thing missing on this phone is wireless charging. Looks like I will be getting the Note 8 Looks like a border to me on that phone. I don't see anything borderless. And that screen size look way smaller than 6""",Sony's super-high-end Xperia XZ Premium goes on sale in the U.S. June 12 for $799

         We'll have to wait a while and pay a lot for Sony's latest. According to a listing at Amazon UK that has since been removed, Sony's new top-end phone, the Xperia XZ Premium, will release on June 1 at a price of £649. Though the Xperia XZ Premium was launched back at MWC 2017 at the end of February, Sony wasn't willing to give any sort of tips about pricing or availability — save for one mention of the phone coming ""in the second quarter"". The June time frame makes sense, as its new Snapdragon 835 processor won't be available at volume for some time if the rumors are correct that Samsung is putting the new chip in its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus — taking up most of Qualcomm's supply.  As for the price, it's a typically high price tag you'll find on most Sony phones still. At £649 in the UK, it'll be one of the most expensive mainstream phones available, going head-to-head with other pricey options, like the Google Pixel XL. Coming out of MWC 2017, we speculated that the Xperia XZ Premium would actually cost more than this, considering the components inside — including that Snapdragon 835 and a 4K display — and Sony's propensity for pricing well above market. We'll have to wait a couple more months for pre-orders to actually go live with an official price, but for now we at least have a frame of reference for how much you'll have to lay down for an Xperia XZ Premium. So expect to pay the equivalent of $800 or so, depending on the region. In some places they include a bluetooth speaker with the Xperia Premium. The price is high of course. But I guess the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 will have a similar price to.
Personally I might go for the Xperia XZs instead with the same cameramodule as Premium. But a little smaller and cheaper device. I'm surprised by that pricing. What's the catch? No catch at all that I can see. I already paid for it and I received two emails from the retailer...the second one stating that it is in the processing phase. It seems to me that when we try to do a currency conversion online that we end up with a higher dollar amount than when we actually order the product. Someone mentioned earlier that we don't have to pay any tax like those in the UK have to. But so far that is the price - $676.63 That was me, 'price would be £540.83 + £18.00 for DHL = around $680 USD, at least on Clove site. ""If the shipping destination is not an EU member state, VAT will not be charged on any order.""'  I just rounded to account for daily changes in currency conversion.  Only reason I have not ordered to replace my Z3 is because I want the Chrome one. Already pre-ordered from unlocked-mobiles...cost = $676.63 US dollars. Not sure why everyone thinks this phone will cost so much?? Purchased yesterday. I love the looks because it doesn't look like all the iPhone/Samsung clones out there, though I am not fond of glass backs. Got the black one. How can he complain about price?  It is cheaper than G6. S8 may be £799 and S8+ £899.  - 4k hdr display with triluminos and x reality
- Sd 835 + 4gb ram (2,3 available)
- Ip 65/68
- Blutooth 5.0
- Gigabit LTE
- Motion Eye 960fps super slow motion
- Hi Res audio   + LDAC for bluetooth headset
- Noise cancelling
- Qnovo battery care
- Stamina mode
- Android 7.1
- Fingerprint scanner
- Stereo sound + Dual front speakers Many other stuff of Xperia UI Fingerprint scanner? Not in the US...! It's an unlocked phone and will work just fine in the US. Buy from the UK and it will all be in English WITH the fingerprint reader. Or, buy from US when available and flash UK firmware to enable fingerprint scanner. So if I want it in the US I have to modify it? Nope... Not doing that. Not really much of a ""mod"" IF it doesn't require root. If I was in the market for a new phone I would consider it if I wouldn't have to root since flashing takes the all of 5 minutes. I don't keep up with all the tax rules, but I'm 90% sure if in USA we would not have to pay VAT. So price would be £540.83 + £18.00 for DHL = around $680 USD, at least on Clove site.  ""If the shipping destination is not an EU member state, VAT will not be charged on any order."" Correct the prices across regions are not simply ""take GBP price, convert to USD and there you go"" — it'll be slightly different based on the market. And remember that there's often a difference between the price of importing a phone to the U.S. and buying directly from Sony in the U.S. You can look back at the Xperia X Performance and XZ, comparing U.S. and UK prices, to get a better feel for how this'll price out if £649 is indeed the launch price. My guess would be like $749 USD. Soon you'll read people saying,  ""Wow, $1000 dollars ain't to bad considering the specs..."" lol Exactly why I'll be looking at OnePlus, Honor, or Huwei for my next phone. So true! I guess people mean its not too bad compared to the price of other big brand flagships. However what I'd be asking is do I need a big name/make phone anymore? Step away from the big names like Samsung and you can get a phone thats every bit as good (or better in some cases) for half or two thirds of the price.  In fairness to this Sony at least it has some features (the screen and probably camera) which may make it worth the extra for some people. Spending more to get a specific feature not available on some/all other phones make sense but I suspect a lot of people buying the latest big brand phone would be every bit as happy with something from a less well known name for half the price. I'm getting tired of it. We, the people are letting it happen. We just keep buying everything they put out. I always a model or two behind and typically buy off ebay without a contract. I don't mind bezels but man isn't this a bit too much bezel? Those huge bezels compliments Sony's overall hardware design. They just look nicer on Sony's phone for some reason. Even though the bezels are pretty wide? I can say the the htc 10 I'm currently using has a thinner bezel than my former xperia z3 which I never had this problem. And I tend to push the back arrow button, recent app, and home button(especially, when using  camera in portrait orientation) by mistake very often, it's  getting to the point of annoying for me. Unless you have a really tiny thumb it might be ok for you but who has a really tiny thumb? I say to the people who want thin bezels? Have even tried a phone with thin bezels before?
I would definitely prefer function over form any day. Big bezels. Thankfully it's only a 5.5-inch display. Wow, $800 doesn't sound too bad at all, especially with the build quality and specifications. Maybe someone at Sony said something about pricing. These phones cannot be bought through a carrier correct? I want to want this. I love Sony's software and often impressive battery life. But I cannot ignore those horrific 2013 bezels. Hopefully, John Legere is aware of this phone and
that he will offer the XZ Premium on T-Mobile. It is truly looking to be a great flagship phone  for Sony. Their premium lineup needs some more variety. This Sony phone would make an excellent addition. If they can sell the Alcatel Idol 4s with Windows 10 then they should be able to sell this. Sony is done selling through U.S. carriers. Great news!  The only really bad thing about my Z3 is all the T-Mobile bloatware.  I can deal with the Sony stuff as it can actually be deleted or I actually use it.  Except for the Visual Voicemail, I don't use any of the Tmo software. That's....actually not too bad considering what it has. And significantly lower than what I (and the rest of us, I think) expected, considering Sony's track record with pricing. Yeah, we were all expecting it to be the typical Sony pricing but compared to what Apple, Samsung, and even Google are now doing, so my isn't so bad. Strange... The price is actually very good. Funny that you compare it to the pixel since the XZ premium specs put the pixel to shame for the price. I compare it to the Pixel because Google's charging a very similar price for the Pixel XL. Many thought this phone would be priced at a grand for its specs. 4k hdr screen, 64gb storage, dual front firing speakers, ip68 etc. Really shows how little you get for the same price in a pixel.  Just wish it had smaller bezels and a larger battery and this phone could be phone of the year. Sony normally does well with battery life for some reason. Front facing speakers over bezelless phones for me. Now the Pixel's huge chin is just hideous. No front facing speakers or physical home button or anything for that matter. 👎",Sony Xperia XZ Premium tipped for June release at £649
