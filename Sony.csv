"Sony has unveiled its latest flagship smartphone. Named the Xperia XZ, it builds on the heritage of both the Xperia Z and the Xperia X series, bringing along a refreshed design and up-to-date specs. Let's dig into this beast's spec sheet and see what it's made of!
Measuring 146 x 72 x 8.1mm, the Xperia XZ weights 161g and boasts a new ""Unified Design"" language with a gentle form and matching body and user interface colors. It also features tapered loop surfaces, while the body is made of a special aluminium alloy called Alkaleido. Its properties include better purity and a brighter, shinier look. The smartphone is IP68-certified and features a USB Type C port with USB 2.0 speeds. The signature color is Forest Blue, but the smartphone also comes in Mineral Black and Platinum.
Sony equipped its new flagship smartphone with a 5.2-inch, 1080p resolution LCD display covered in Gorilla Glass 4. It's a traditional configuration for Sony's high-end smartphones that typically eschew Quad-HD resolutions in favor of the universally accepted 1080p resolution. The display is boosted by software technologies such as Triluminos and X-Reality to maximize its color and brightness and make it deliver punchier colors.
The Sony Xperia XZ is powered by the ubiquitous Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset that features a quad-core processor (up to 2.15GHz) and the powerful Adreno 530 GPU (clocked to 624MHz). This is one of the fastest chips around, although Qualcomm has already started marketing its successor, the Snapdragon 821. It looks like the latest-generation Snapdragon couldn't be supplied in time for the Xperia XZ's launch. Not that users will be missing out on any thrilling innovation or tangible speed increases, as the Snapdragon 820, fully designed by Qualcomm, still holds its own with the best of them.
Sony has decided to showcase its camera department's best work with the Xperia XZ, for the smartphone comes with a 23MP main camera powered by a custom Sony IMX300 imaging sensor. The camera has an f/2.0 aperture and features laser autofocus, PDAF, and an RGBC-IR color sensor. It also boasts 5-axis software stabilization. On the front, there's a 13MP camera with a 1/3-inch sensor, which is larger than those traditionally used in front cameras.
The smartphone will be sold for a price north of $600 starting October. It will debut globally, although the United States will get it at a later point. A seemingly solid offering, the Xperia XZ's success will depend on how well Sony markets it. The smartphone market is already saturated with great handsets that run fast, look fantastic, and take excellent photos. Despite its 23MP camera, the Xperia XZ might have a hard time standing out.
A 2900mAh battery runs the system with support for Quick Charge and a bespoke battery preservation tech that sees the smartphone stop charging at 90% and finish the rest of the battery slower as to prevent the cells from damage.

"Sony is on an aggressive schedule: while most other companies are launching their new flagship phones once in a year, Sony is updating its top-line Xperia phones much more often, with a new phone every six months or so.
Sony has always had a name for a company that makes elegant, stylish devices and the Xperia XZ undeniably looks like one.
Finally, the phone is also conveniently IP68 certified, meaning it is water- and dust-resistant: it can withstand a 30-minute stay in water, up to 3 feet deep, but rather than being made for use in water, it’s mostly meant to survive occurrences like the rain or an accidental drop in the toilet.
The Sony Xperia XZ features a 5.2-inch Full HD display (1080 x 1920 pixels) of an IPS LCD kind. “Triluminous”, “X-Reality”, Sony does not shy away from throwing in a bunch of pompous marketing names to convince everyone in the superior qualities of this screen.
If you’ve used a Sony phone a few years ago and now happen to pick up the new Sony Xperia XZ, you probably would not find much of a difference.
Most top-shelf phones in 2016 come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 system chip, and the Sony Xperia XZ is no exception: we have the 820 with 3GB of RAM here.
With 32GB of space on board that can also be expanded via a microSD card, the Xperia XZ is a happy member of that new wave of devices. At the same time, it’s puzzling that the otherwise simplistic Xperia skin takes up a lot of space. You only get around 20GB of user available space out of the 32 gigs, and that’s really not as much as it might sound.
The Sony Xperia XZ features Google’s mobile Chrome as its default and only browser. It does the job well, and we’re happy that we don’t have to deal with a confusing two-browser situation.
The main camera on the Xperia XZ features a custom-made Sony IMX300 sensor of 1/2.3"" size, which is currently one of the largest sensor sizes we've seen on phones. On top of it is a Sony G lens with f/2.0 aperture and a 6-element construction. This more complicated construction with additional elements theoretically allows better image clarity across the whole image. Up front, the Xperia XZ is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera.
Then, there is the fact that the Xperia XZ has a 23-megapixel camera, but its default Superior Auto captures 8MP images. If you go into settings, you can actually choose between: 23MP (4:3), 20MP (16:9), 8MP (4:3) and 8MP (16:9). We compared images at the full resolution and the 8-megapixel once, and we like the latter better: they have slightly better dynamics and clarity, and we recommend shooting in 8MP resolution.
Image quality on the Xperia XZ is fine, but by no means extraordinary or even on par with devices like the Apple iPhone 7 series, Samsung’s Galaxy S7 family, LG’s G5, or the HTC 10.
We’ve already walked you through the counter-intuitive way to switch to 4K video (you can’t record 4K video in the ‘video’ mode, you have to swipe up to the camera apps, and select 4K from there) and we’ve already told you that it takes forever to switch to 4K video and the interface is absolutely contrary to intuitive.
Another interesting thing is that the Xperia XZ is one of the first phones that we see that supports the H.265 encoding standard for video. The default one is the H.264 encoding that has been used on phones since forever, but you can switch to the H.265 and the result is much smaller files. For instance, 1 minute of 4K video recorded using the tradition H.264 encoding resulted in a 397MB file, while shooting the absolutely same scene for 1 minute in H.265 resulted in a file that is just 254MB, nearly 36% smaller.
In a time of YouTube and Facebook for videos, as well as Spotify and Apple Music for our music needs, the default music and video players on our phones are getting less and less use. Still, those with sentiment for offline music would still use the built-in apps. There are two music apps on the Xperia XZ, the Google Play one, and a custom-made application that has a clean, straight-forward interface with nice visuals.
Call quality is fine, but not excellent on the Xperia XZ. Voices through the earpiece sound a bit muffled and lacking in clarity, but not to the point where it’s hard to discern what your caller is saying, and they get sufficiently loud.
The Sony Xperia XZ features a non-removable 2,900 mAh battery. Sony made it clear that it is introducing some clever tricks to keep it healthy in the long run by preventing it from overcharging and damaging its chemistry. However what most users will be really interested in is actual battery life in daily use.
Another interesting thing we test is charge times: how much does it take to fully recharge the phone from 0 to 100% using the wall charger and cable provided in the box?
So there you have it, the Sony Xperia XZ scores in the middle of the pack in terms of battery life, and it is annoyingly slow to recharge. 
Frankly, we’re perplexed by the price of the Sony Xperia XZ: it's sold at a whopping $700 in the United States. We expect this price to quickly go down in the coming few months, but right now, it looks less competitive than the Samsung Galaxy S7 that you can get for $100 less, the futuristic Galaxy S7 Edge available at around the same price, and the outstanding iPhone 7 for $50 less.
he Xperia XZ has some things going for it: it has stylish looks and a clean design, it’s conveniently water-proof and features properly positioned dual front-firing speakers. However, there are just so many places where it falls short, especially compared to the strong competition: its display features bluish and not properly balanced colors, it sometimes stutters, it has a fairly scarce 20GB of user-available storage space, its camera is slow and often counter-intuitive, with images and videos that are not on the same level as the ones from iPhones and Galaxies, it lacks quick charging and in the United States it even ships without a fingerprint scanner.
For $50 less, you can get the excellent Apple iPhone 7 that delivers the same waterproofing, but also an exquisite body, an amazing camera and outstanding, smooth performance. For $100 less, you can get the also superior Galaxy S7 with its more compact design and excellent camera.
Sony, however, has pointed out that slow charging might come with some benefits. Sony is introducing a new smart charging option in the Xperia XZ. With nightly charges, what happens is that the battery remains plugged in long after it's fully charged and this continuous trickle charge is stressful to a battery cell and makes it degrade faster. Sony's clever trick here is that it learns that you usually wake up at, say, 7am, and it would stop charging the battery at night when it reaches around 90%, and will only resume charging closer to your wake-up time. This way, you still wake up with a fully charged battery, but the damage from excessive charging is avoided.
All of this hopefully should mean that battery health will remain excellent in the long run, but for users looking for the daily charging results, the score is really nothing to write home about.
In the case of the Xperia XZ, there is a 5V 1.5A (7.5-watt) wall charger and a USB-C cable provided. As you can see, this is no quick charger with such a low power output, so expectations for fast recharging were not high, but it was quite a shock to see such a slow charge.
It took us nearly three hours to fully charge the Xperia XZ! The exact charge time stood at 2 hours and 54 minutes, more than that of all modern phones.
That's why we put it through its paces in our standardized battery test that puts all phones on equal playing ground: we set their screens at 200 nits of brightness, a level comfortable for indoor use, and run a custom script that measures typical phone use with no off-screen time. So how much did the Xperia XZ score?
Don't expect miracles: its 2,900mAh batteries scored a good, but not great 6 hours and 41 minutes, practically on par with the Samsung Galaxy S7 with Snapdragon. While not outstanding, the Xperia XZ battery still lasted longer than the one on the LG G5 and Nexus 5X, but less than the battery of the iPhone 6s.
The experience on the other end of the line is similar: slightly muffled and lacking in clarity, but again, not terrible.
We’re happy that Sony has built two front-facing speakers in the XZ: that’s the right direction for audio that you listen to. They are not mind-blowing in quality, but get sufficiently loud and while lacking in depth, provide fairly clean audio.
The photo gallery on the XZ allows you to pinch to zoom in and out easily in images, and can also show you pictures by the place they’re taken in, plus, it can also sort your favorite image files or help you view only videos, for instance. We still recommend the much richer, cloud-based Google Photos that also comes pre-installed.
So everyone should just switch to H.265, right? Not really: unfortunately, the new H.265 is still not widely supported and YouTube in particular fails to recognize H.265 videos. Until major services like YouTube don’t add support for this new codec, we don’t recommend using it.
There is another peculiarity about the Xperia XZ: while on all phones that we’ve ever tested, you can record a 4K video even without unlocking the phone, on the Xperia XZ you can only record 1080p video with an unlocked phone, but if you try to switch to 4K the phone - contrary to any and all logic - asks you to unlock the phone.
Why is this important? 4K video happens to look much sharper and better than 1080p, even when you look at it on YouTube on a regular 1080p monitor. It’s a noticeable difference. Yet, if you want to record something quickly, like that time that cat did something funny for a moment, you are more likely to miss it with such clunky controls.
4K video on the Sony Xperia XZ is recorded at 30fps and comes with stabilization turned off by default, which results in very shaky and unpleasant-looking videos. We recommend you go into settings in the 4K mode and enable the Steady Shot option. It’s worth noting that the view you get is also a significantly cropped view of what you get in 1080p.
While earlier Sony phones tended to capture very natural looking colors, Sony seems to have changed that quite a bit with the XZ, which takes pictures that have a very noticeable contrast, saturation and sharpening boost. Despite this quite obvious oversharpening, in areas of uniform color, details appear smudged out and not all that clear. Some artifacts like color fringing are also particularly easy to notice.
Focusing is, on the other hand, fast and accurate. Sony is also proud of its tracking auto-focus feature and here is how it works: tap on a moving object on your screen and the phone will automatically lock the focus on it and track it as it moves. It might work in the lab and in some carefully orchestrated conditions, but in real life it is hit or miss. It won’t track small objects, for instance, and with Sony’s super wide-angle camera, most objects appear small unless you zoom in. We also didn't have much luck with faster moving objects.
The built-in single LED flash is strong, but introduces a cold, green-ish cast to images that ruins the colors and we’d rather not use it at all.
When it comes to the front camera, we’re content with it, but again, we don’t find it to be extraordinary. In good light, it captures fairly sharp selfies that, with outstanding detail and sharpness, really a class above even when compared with the selfie cameras on the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6s Plus. Indoors and in dim light, though, images do often turn slightly blurry and don’t look nearly as impressive.
There’s also a manual mode that allows you to tweak shutter speed, exposure, white balance, and manually focus. It also comes with a bunch of ‘scenes’: soft skin, soft snap, anti-motion blur, landscape, backlight correction HDR, night portrait, night scene, hand-held twilight, high sensitivity, gourmet, pet, beach, snow, party, sports, document and fireworks. Yup, 17 different modes! Is your head spinning already? Ours is too! It’s hard to imagine many people apart from die-hard enthusiasts reading through that whole list, and it’s even harder to see who would use them. Even if you wanted to use them, though, there is absolutely no explanation to what they do: what does the ‘Pet’ mode do, for example, and how is it different from ‘Gourmet’? It’s good to have options, but it also helps to know what those options actually do. Here’s the trick, though, the phone automatically selects the right mode of these 17 when you shoot in Superior Auto, so why even bother with manual? And here’s the kicker: despite all those tons of options, there is actually no easy way to enable and disable something as common as HDR! To do this, you have to open a menu, switch on a toggle, close the menu, and only then shoot in HDR. So in conclusion: yes, the Xperia XZ is a feature-packed camera, but rather than that being a plus, it ends up making it overcomplicated and far from intuitive.
In terms of special sauce for the main camera, Sony brings in an additional laser AF that helps lock focus faster, and also a color sensor that helps the phone properly set the white balance of an image.
The Sony camera app is a worthy subject of a separate discussion, as it has so many peculiarities that it’s hard to sum them up in a few sentences. Unfortunately, most of them are not something that Sony should be proud about. First, speed: it’s slow in operation. We did a quick hands on test capturing pictures with most major phones from iPhones to Galaxies, LGs, and even the cheaper OnePlus, and it was shocking, but also revealing that the Sony was the only one to give us a loading circle practically every time you capture a picture with the Xperia XZ. The interface also feels clunky: a swipe switches you from photo to video mode, but that switch takes a long few seconds and the video mode for some reason does not allow you to shoot in 4K. Yet, the Xperia XZ does support 4K capture, but you need to scroll further up to camera apps, and only then select 4K video! These are all things that are far from intuitive.
Chrome is well fitted for use on mobile with its card-based interface, syncing across other platforms including desktop and tablet, and fast rendering speeds.
What about 4G LTE connectivity? There will be different versions of the Xperia XZ for different markets, and the band compatibility also varies. Sony is yet to announce particular 4G LTE bands, but since there will be a U.S.-bound model, you can expect proper band support as well.
In terms of other connectivity options, you also have Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC support.
We have no complaints about this hardware configuration, but what we did notice is that the actual performance of the phone is not perfectly optimized. There is the occasional stutter here and there, and frame rates in animations when switching between apps are also stuttery, and that’s something that we just can’t excuse in a top-shelf phone these days.
Gamers should also know that the XZ comes with the Adreno 530 GPU, which is one of the fastest graphics solutions on mobile. Yes, this means that it should be able to handle even the most demanding games with a consistent frame-rate, and also be future-proof. Take a look at the benchmark scores to see how it fares against the competition.
Yes, we have the same old Sony skin on top of Android 6 Marshmallow here, and there are two things to keep in mind: first, the Sony skin is rather simple, but also without much of a special sauce, it starts to feel a bit bland; and secondly, given that the XZ will launch in the same time as Android 7 Nougat, we can see how many would be annoyed (rightfully) for not having the latest version of Google’s platform.
Let’s start with what’s new: Sony has built in an app cache cleaner and unlike the many apps with similar functionality on the Play Store, this one is absolutely invisible and automatic, so you don’t have to open it and press a button every time you see your phone slow down.
Next, Sony also brings some quite neat and stylish themes with colors matching that of the body of the phone. They don’t bring the radical customization that you might be used to seeing in Samsung phones, or via custom themes for Android launchers, but are still a very nice touch.
We are not very happy with a few of the basic features of the XZ: particularly, the on-screen keyboard. Sony uses SwiftKey and by default it is set to give absolutely no haptic feedback to typing, which slows down typing. Even if you find how to enable haptic feedback (Settings > Language & Input > SwiftKey keyboard > Typing > Sound & Vibration > Enable vibration), the feedback is neither as clear as on, say, Samsung phones, nor as quick as it should be. Yes, it’s not terrible, but in a 2016 flagship, we expect more.
But first, sharpness: a 5.2” Full HD display is sharp enough so that most users won’t see pixelization. We find no issue with it, hence, no reason to complain about it not being a Quad HD display. To be perfectly exact, there is one scenario when a Quad HD display would actually be more beneficial: if you mount your phone in a VR headset, you can actually see a real difference in sharpness there. But as far as normal usage is concerned, 1080 x 1920 px is a-OK.
Onto the colors, the Xperia XZ features strongly oversaturated colors and cold temperature that would annoy photographers looking for color accuracy, as well as those who care about true colors. We do, and from that standpoint, we are not happy with the color rendition on the Xperia XZ.
At the same time, if you are not particularly picky about color accuracy, the screen is not terrible: again, colors are unrealistic, but they also ‘pop’ more and the screen gets sufficiently bright to be comfortable to use in various conditions.
While it retains the DNA of a Sony Xperia phone with its sharp corners and somewhat bulky size, it also now comes with edges that are tapered and more comfortable to hold, an approach that Sony calls ‘loop’ design. The back is made out of a special aluminum alloy that Sony calls ‘Alkaleido’. In real life, it’s a shiny metal finish with a very smooth coating that actually makes it feel a bit like glass or glossy plastic. Its slightly colder temperature, however, gives out its true nature. And it looks good when it’s clean, but as all glossy surfaces, it's good at catching fingerprints and getting smudged easily.
Upon closer inspection, however, one can’t help but notice that the sides of the phone are all made of plastic and there is a strap of plastic at the bottom edge of the rear panel for better reception. The physical buttons - all of them are on the right side - are also made of plastic and don’t feel nowhere near as clicky or well made as the ones on Galaxies and iPhones of today. In the international version of the Xperia XZ there is a fingerprint scanner built in the side-positioned power/lock key and it works fast and well, but - quite shockingly for a late 2016 flagship - there is no fingerprint scanner on the U.S. version of the phone. We guess that this has something to do with patents because otherwise this makes absolutely no sense.
Up front, there is a beautifully laminated screen with Gorilla Glass 4 (yet others are already using the tougher Gorilla Glass 5) that uses on-screen Android navigation keys. There are two front-firing speakers, which is a nice addition, while on the bottom of the phone there is a USB-C port for charging, whereas the 3.5mm headset jack is on the top.
The Xperia XZ comes in a choice of three colors: the signature for the model Forest Blue (aka dark blue), as well as a Mineral Black (black) and Platinum (bright gray) versions. We like this good-looking color selection, and as you can see we have the Forest Blue up for review.
Last fall, we had the Xperia Z5, then in the beginning of June 2016, Sony released the Xperia X and Xperia X Performance, and now, just a few months after that, we have another new top-shelf phone: the Xperia XZ.
Sony Xperia XZ Review
Despite this quick pace of upgrades, little changes in the Xperia line over time: most of the top-shelf Xperia phones evolve very gradually. The new Sony Xperia XZ is probably the biggest update to the series with a brand new ‘loop’ design that changes the appearance of the phone, but even this does not make it a very significant change: yes, it has a slightly larger screen and a slightly larger battery than the X Performance, but the specs and software are nearly identical.
Under the hood, the Sony Xperia XZ features the same top-shelf Snapdragon 820 system chip, with 3GB of RAM on board and the base version of the handset has 32GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD cards. Sony has, however, improved the camera with a 23-megapixel sensor with 5-axis software stabilization and laser auto-focus that speeds up focusing. Let’s see if there are any other improvements and if Sony can pull out a surprise with the XZ.

",http://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Sony-Xperia-XZ-Review_id4255
"Sony's latest flagship, the Xperia Z6 comes with refined design, improved camera, and a due update in specs. Wait, back up a little there - it's actually called the Xperia XZ this time around but, yeah, the rest of that is true.
When Sony announced the new X-series, some suggested that the Xperia X Performance was meant to take on the likes of the Galaxy S7's and HTC 10's, but we knew that couldn't be the case. Okay, 'suspected' might be more accurate there. Obviously, now we all know that the Xperia XZ is Sony's top-dog for this season, and the Z in its name quickly reveals its ancestry.
We're yet to see tangible proof that the RAM race leads to actual usability benefits, but if people were to reason that way, the industry would sit still. It would have been great though, if Sony could have gone with 4GB just to keep up with the times and avoid having reviewers write this paragraph and make them look bad. The extra 1GB can't cost that much, right?
Finally, once again, Americans are denied fingerprint recognition. The hardware is there, apparently the paperwork isn't, so Sony can't offer the feature on the US market. We do have it on our international version review unit, and we'll test it for the rest of you to know, but not before we take a look at the hardware on the following page.
The Sony Xperia XZ measures 146 x 72 x 8.1mm, the exact same footprint as the Xperia Z5 it comes to succeed, but 0.8mm thicker. It's still not as thick as the Xperia X Performance and its 8.7mm, and nowhere near the chunky 9.5mm X Compact.
At 161g, the Xperia is precisely as heavy as the HTC flagship. The G5 is 2g lighter, while the Galaxy S7 trumps them all with its weight of 152g. Sony's own Z5 was 154g, but the more recent X Performance is closer to the Xperia XZ at 164 g.
Sony's smartphone design has traditionally been about evolution, refinement, and polishing, rather than striking changes from one generation to another. That said, it does show that on the XZ designers did more than move around the front camera and sensors.
The design is a stylish mix of sharp edges and smooth curves throughout. The sides are fluid, flowing from front to back with only miniscule gaps between the frame and the adjacent surfaces. Sony calls this design 'loop surface', because design concepts are always better with fancy names, but other than that, it sure looks and feels nice.
And mind you, those are three different materials you're touching - glass on the front (an unspecified generation Gorilla Glass), polycarbonate on the frame and ALKALEIDO metal on the back.
Mineral Black is what our review unit's color is called, but depending on how light hits it, it can be deep purple, or brown or anything in between. It is ALKALEIDO's smooth satin finish to thank for all this sparkle.
In terms of space management, the Xperia XZ is typical Sony - ample bezels all around, but especially above and below the display. Sure, there are the stereo speakers to somewhat make up for them, but still we feel that shaving a millimeter or two wouldn't hurt.
The top and bottom didn't get the memo on the whole loop surface thing, though. Sharp transitions and flat surfaces dominate here, but you shouldn't mind - that's not where all the swiping and tapping happens. For the purpose of looking good they certainly fit the bill.
The control layout is typical Sony too. The fingerprint reader/power button is on the right, a little bit above midpoint. It's easily accessible with either a right thumb, or a left index finger, so you should be okay no matter which hand you normally use. If it's the left one though, the sensor may have a slightly lower success rate due to the more awkward handling position. Hands and fingers vary, and so will your experience - we had no issues operating it.
That doesn't necessarily apply to the volume rocker though, even if it's a quibble - it could have been placed a little higher. We appreciate the two-stage manual shutter button, but increasingly more so for its ability to launch the camera super quickly and less as an actual shutter release. We've already grown accustomed to taking pictures with tapping, but more importantly, exercising force on the small physical button often results in slightly misaligned shots and camera shake on such small devices where you can't get a steady grip (as opposed to an actual digicam).
On the left side, you'll find the card slot. Our unit takes one nano-SIM card and a microSD card, but a dual-SIM model will be available with a shared slot between the second SIM and the microSD.
Sony is confident it nailed the flagship display size and resolution with the Xperia Z2 and has been sticking with it ever since, now including the Xperia XZ. A 5.2-inch FullHD display means a density of 424ppi, which is plenty sharp. However, the likes of LG and Samsung have moved to QHD for similarly sized displays, and Sony is trailing in the specs race.
The display posted very good scores across the board with the only exception of color accuracy. The maximum brightness of 502nits in manual mode goes as high as 608 nits in auto mode, with bright light shining into the XZ.
Color reproduction is not great, though. The average DeltaE of 5.8 is decent, but there is a pronounced blue cast to white and gray. Other than that, out of the primaries, green is off the most (DeltaE around 10), and cyan is far from the truth as well.
The Xperia XZ is well stocked on connectivity options. Our review unit is the single-SIM version (F8331 model name), but there's also a dual-SIM one (F8332). The slot in that case is of the hybrid variety though - it's either a second SIM or a microSD card - you can't have all three.
The Xperia XZ relies on a 2,900mAh battery to keep it powered. That's the same capacity as the Xperia Z5 before it, while the Xperia X Performance has a 2,700mAh power pack. The majority of current Android flagships are around that number too, with the HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 having a smidgen more juice to work with (3,000mAh), and the LG G5 - slightly less (2,800mAh). The iPhone 7, on the other hand, makes do with a substantially smaller capacity - 1,960mAh.
Much like the previous X-series phones, the Xperia XZ has the Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in. The technology allows the phone to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan.
So what does Battery Care do? Say you charge your phone overnight, and you regularly plug it in at midnight and unplug it at 8 in the morning. In time, the phone will recognize the pattern, charge the battery to 90% and then stop charging. And then at, say, 7:30 in the morning it will pick up where it left off and top it all up to 100% at a slower pace. If it hasn't picked up your routine, it'll do a standard charge.
Ultra Stamina is for absolutely dire occasions when you don't expect to be able to find a power outlet for a long period of time. Enable that and it's back to basics where you get a single homescreen with access to the dialer and contacts, text messages, camera, clock - just the basics. Going out of Ultra Stamina requires a restart.
The Xperia XZ in our office is running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and that's what retail units will ship with out of the box. An update to Nougat is planned, naturally, and recent speculations point to an October date.
Sony tends to keep the stock Android look, except for a few gentle touches here and there. The big stuff, like the proprietary Stamina battery saving modes and the home-baked multimedia apps are here as well.
Smart Lock gives you conditional security - trusted nearby devices, locations, faces, or voices can allow you to skip the security unlock protocol.
The homescreen appears unchanged from the rest of the X series. This includes the swipe down gesture, which shows a screen of the apps you use most along with recommendations for new apps to install. The search field is highlighted so you can start typing the app's name immediately.
The traditional app drawer is present, and you'll find a number of proprietary apps pre-installed. Sony takes great pride in the A/V prowess of their devices, and the multimedia apps are all custom and feature-rich, but more on them in their dedicated chapter.
Themes are available (both free and paid) that can customize the look and sound of the Xperia XZ. Some themes are even interactive with wallpapers reacting to your touches.
The notification area is plain Android. You can re-arrange the quick toggle tiles and adjust the screen brightness. What's missing is a toggle for Auto brightness (you need to go into the settings for that). That's the single thing we don't mind getting changed by manufacturers and still, many of them like to keep this aspect stock.
The Smart cleaner feature will periodically empty the cache of apps you haven't used in awhile. You can switch this off or just manually tell it not to bother for certain apps.
The Sony Xperia XZ is powered by the Snapdragon 820 SoC like the majority of Android flagships this year. The chipset is not exclusive to the XZ in Sony's lineup either - the X Performance runs on Qualcomm high-end silicon as well.
GeekBench 4 hasn't been around long enough yet, but we do have a few devices to measure the XZ up against, and the comparison isn't making it look good either. Sure, the A10 chip in the iPhone 7 is a powerhouse, but the Sony smartphone is a few percent behind the Galaxy S7 edge and the OnePlus 3, both powered by the same Snapdragon 820 chipset.
Moving on to Basemark OS II 2.0 to look at some numbers representing overall performance. Here the XZ is in a group with its X Performance brother and the Xiaomi Mi5. The Snapdragon-powered S7 edge and the OnePlus 3 post a few percent higher scores, the Moto Z is substantially ahead, and the iPhone 7 is in a league of its own. On a positive note, the XZ outperforms both the LG G5 and the HTC 10.
Antutu is not showing the Xperia XZ in a good light either - compared to other similarly equipped devices, that is. Save for the Xperia X Performance, the XZ is the lowest-ranked Snapdragon 820 smartphone here, with the HTC 10 and Moto Z far ahead. The Huawei P9 loses to the Sony flagship once again.
On the graphics front, the Xperia XZ does a good job with Basemark X scores on par with the LG G5 and marginally ahead of the HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 edge (Exynos). Other models post higher figures here on the same hardware - it's a matter of fine-tuning.
In GFXBench the Xperia XZ is among the better-performing Snapdragon 820's. In the Car Scene, in particular, the Sony manages to top the chart beating everyone in the onscreen part (not a big feat, considering a lot of the competitors sport 1440p screens), but also in the offscreen section, rendered at 1080p on all devices. A similar showing in Manhattan - highest S820 score onscreen, second best offscreen. The iPhone 7 breezes through this test thanks to a combination of powerful GPU and low screen resolution.
A Snapdragon 820 was always going to be powerful, and inside the Xperia XZ it shows its muscle. Other makers have done a better job of tailoring the SoC to their needs, though, and the XZ often ends up behind. It's a top-of-the-line chipset, of course, and you won't be left waiting for it - it's just that it's potentially capable of a little more as seen in other devices.
The Sony Xperia XZ we have for review is the single-SIM version (F8331). A dual-SIM version will also be available on some markets with a model designation F8332. That one uses a hybrid slot for the second SIM card, shared with the microSD card.
The Sony Xperia XZ has front-firing stereo speakers, just like every Sony flagship since the Xperia Z2 (and some recent midrangers too). In principle, we'll take this setup over any other in a heartbeat, but Sony's speakers are fairly modest in terms of loudness, falling in the Below average category in our test. None of the major competitors truly excels here, yet they are all ahead of the Xperia.
The Album app is among the most comprehensive and feature-rich gallery apps we've seen, and it's fast and easy to use. At the very top of the list is a slideshow, showing off your photos, lower down, the first photo of each month is shown at twice the size of other images. Photos are organized by month, and you can use pinch-zoom to change the size of thumbnails (then they smoothly animate into the grid).
You can instead browse photos on a map (you can manually add geotag info too) or by folder. This includes network storage so that you can view photos from a DLNA server (your home computer, for one). Then there's integration with online albums - Facebook, Picasa, Flickr.
Movie Creator is similar to the Assistant of Google Photos. It automatically creates short videos from the photos and videos you've shot. You can do it manually too: pick photos and videos, change their order, add color effects and music (you get a small audio collection to start you off, but can use custom files too). Then tap the Share button and send out your animated slideshow.
The Music app feels like a part of the same software package as the rest of the custom Sony stuff. The contextual side menu offers much of the same browsing options - by folder, network folder and online services, in this case, Spotify (it's just a link to the Spotify app though). You can share music from the phone to compatible players.
The app can find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google.
The Sony Xperia XZ delivered excellently clean output when used with an active external amplifier, getting top marks across the board. Its output loudness was just above average so it’s a very decent performance overall.
Degradation caused by headphones is more than we are used to seeing from flagships with a moderate hike in stereo crosstalk, a little intermodulation distortion and slightly shakier frequency response. Those are hard to detect without dedicated equipment, but the fall in volume is easy to be felt. All in all the output will please the majority of users, but we certainly expect better from a flagship these days.
And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.
The Music app offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ determines the best audio quality settings depending on the track you're listening to. Then there's DSEE HX, which uses an almost wizardly algorithm supposed to restore or rather extrapolate compressed music files, like MP3s into high-res audio. According to Sony, the result is near Hi-Res Audio Quality, but it only works with wired headphones.
Dynamic normalizer evens out the volume differences across tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.
Image editing is handled by several apps, including Sketch and Sticker creator (so you can create your own custom stickers to send to your friends).
Sketch lets you fingerpaint over a photo or a paper-like texture, add text, stickers, photos and so on. If you're talented (the below screenshot reveals our mediocrity), you can share your creations on the Sketch mini-social network. We'd stick to just browsing what others drew.
The call log is separated from the contacts, but there's a shortcut to those in the upper right corner. It can be filtered by missed, incoming and outgoing calls. Smart dial is supported too.
Sony Xperia XZ review
In case you've been living under a rock for the past year or so - the Snapdragon 820 is manufactured on a 14nm process, has 4 custom Kryo CPU cores (typically 2x2.15GHz + 2x1.6GHz), and relies on the Adreno 530 for graphics rendering. What sets the XZ apart from all of this year's top-dogs (not exactly in a good way either) is the 3GB of RAM - the rest of the big names have gone with 4GB, with the OnePlus 3 having 6GB of RAM (though it's not actually using all of it actively).
RAM shouldn't have much of an effect on GeekBench scores - a CPU-focused benchmark, and yet the Xperia XZ doesn't fare quite as well as the rest of its peers. In the single-core test of the older GeekBench 3 the XZ places last among all S820 devices, and on par with the Exynos version of the Galaxy S7 edge. The Sony top-dog is comfortably ahead of the Huawei P9, at least.
In the multi-core test the Xperia shows average performance for its hardware and the gaps between the members of Qualcomm camp are minimal. The octa-core CPUs inside the Kirin 955 and Exynos 8890 power the Huawei P9 and Galaxy S7 edge to unreachable levels.

Sony has a proprietary backup solution built-in on its latest Xperias. It can backup applications, contacts, messages, phone settings. The backup info itself can be stored in the cloud under your Sony online account, or locally on the microSD card or an external USB device.
Backups can be scheduled, including conditions like ""Connected to Wi-Fi"" and ""Charging device"", depending on your preferences.
The app switcher is similarly a vanilla Android affair with the 3D rolodex look and a kill-all button. The small apps are gone, however, and there is no longer floating-app multitasking. There isn't screen pinning either like we had on the Xperia X Performance - apparently, not a very popular feature, as we haven't seen it since.
The app drawer is quite functional as well, letting you sort the apps in by frequency of use, name, date installed or a custom arrangement. The app search works here too, and you can go into a management state, allowing you to uninstall multiple apps instead of having to drag each one to a virtual waste bin.
The fingerprint reader introduced on the Z5 series of Xperias is integrated into the Power button on the right side.
We had an excellent user experience with the fingerprint reader on the Xperia XZ. It's fast and accurate. There's an animation that slides the lockscreen away from your thumb (as if you pushed it out of the way). If you have simple swipe unlock enabled (no security) you can tap on the Power button to unlock instead, provided you've woken up the device first.
The handset also supports the Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 (and, of course, 2.0), but we're not sure if it will come bundled with a charger to match. It will most probably be a regional thing.
On the software side of things, there's Sony's Stamina battery saving feature. It has two modes: regular Stamina, and Ultra Stamina. The first disables non-essential features like GPS and vibration, and takes performance down a notch.
Qnovo claims the battery should last hundreds of charge cycles more than a conventionally charged battery. This means a year or so of extra longevity as in theory if the battery ages better, it should hopefully be able to hold charge better in time (an important aspect for a phone that has its battery sealed-in).
Battery Care is another proprietary Sony feature, which however is introduced with the Xperia XZ. It won't be available on all markets though, so if it sounds like something you might be interested in, check back with your local Sony rep.
In our tests the Xperia XZ proved to be excellent at voice calls and an otherwise balanced performer in the other disciplines. In 3G calls the smartphone not only delivered on Sony's promised endurance - but actually even exceeded it. The 23:39h voice call endurance is an hour behind the Galaxy S7 edge, but no match for any of the other competitors, with the iPhone 7 not capable of lasting even half that. The XZ's result is also 3 hours longer than the X Performance's.
Web browsing over Wi-Fi depletes the Xperia XZ's battery in just over 9 hours - not spectacular, but a tangible improvement over the Z5's 7:40h. The XZ matches the HTC 10 in this test (9:08h) and outlasts the LG G5 (7:38h). The Galaxy S7 edge, however, will let you wander the web for 5 and a half hours after the XZ has called it quits.
In looping our test video until the battery is down to 10%, the Xperia XZ lasts for 8 and a half hours, pretty much the same as the X Performance. Compare that to the 4 hours the Z5 barely squeezes out of its same capacity battery. Outside the Sony realm, the HTC 10 is in the same ballpark (8:42h), the iPhone 7 lasts a little longer (9:15h) and the LG G5 beats them all (10:21h). Well, except for the Galaxy S7 edge and its crazy 20 hours of video playback.
Coupled with frugal standby power consumption, the above numbers add up to a combined endurance rating of 72 hours. Of the above competitors only the Galaxy S7 edge manages to top that (98h), the HTC 10 stands at 66h, while the iPhone 7 and LG G5 score 61h and 60h, respectively. The Xperia X Performance's overall results is 61h, while the Z5's 48h look pretty bad in this company.
LTE Cat. 9 (450Mbps down, 50Mbps up) is supported. The phone also comes equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with 2x2 MIMO antennas for speeds up to 433Mbps (if you have an 802.11ac capable router). Local connectivity goes on with Bluetooth 4.2 with aptX and Low Energy, and NFC.
The Wi-Fi connection can be used for screen casting - be it Miracast, Google Cast, or DLNA. If you connect a DualShock controller, the Xperia XZ can even double as a portable console streaming your Playstation 4 games vis PS4 Remote Play. It can also connect to your car's stereo system via MirrorLink.
GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou satellite positioning is supported, unless you're in the US, where it's just GPS and GLONASS.
The Xperia XZ has no FM radio though. Funnily, to get that you'll need to look lower in the lineup - the Xperia X has it.
The USB port is Type-C, but it only conforms to USB 2.0 spec and not 3.0 or 3.1. It lets you hook up USB storage and accessories and charge other devices. Every time you connect it to a PC, you'll need to select the data transfer mode, as it defaults to charge only. That makes sense when you have a form of screen lock enabled to protect the contents of the device. However, on the XZ defaulting to charging is also the case when no security is set up, which is somewhat annoying. Also, on other phones, unlocking the handset immediately identifies it as a media device without the extra intermediate step required.
Sony has dropped MHL support, so you have no wired way to output an image to a TV. You do get 3.5mm analog output to your choice of headphones.
Sunlight legibility, on the other hand is superb. High quality LCD displays have been getting near AMOLEDs in this respect, even if they can't quite match the best of them. The Xperia XZ is on par with the iPhone 6s, and a little short of the iPhone 7 in contrast under direct light, but the LG G5 and especially the HTC 10 are far behind.
Blacks are nicely dark and contrast ratio is excellent - higher than the X Compact, but not as high as the X Performance.
At the lowest setting, brightness is easy on the eyes at 5.2 nits.
The tray has a rubber gasket to keep water and dust out (good), but the phone will invariably restart every time you pull it out (not so good). You may find it particularly irritating if you happen to swap microSD or SIM cards often.
On the bottom you'll find the Type-C USB port. The Xperia XZ is the one of the first two Sony smartphones to have one. Sony only went halfway on this, though - Type-C it may be, but it only adheres to the USB 2.0 specification.
Right next to it is the primary mic.
The top panel has the secondary mic and (thankfully!) a standard 3.5mm jack. Certain manufacturers tend to think that it may no longer be needed but we'll have to disagree.
On the forehead, you'll find one of the speakers in the center, which also doubles as an earpiece for voice calls. On its right are the proximity and ambient light sensors, and on the left you'll find the front-facing camera.
Further to the left, almost on the edge is an LED notification light if you care for such subtle niceties.
What it fails miserably at is keeping fingerprints away. Beautiful as it may be when clean, it's going to be covered in grease for most of its life unless you religiously wipe it with a cloth after each use. Under some angles you may not see it, but it's there. That's a rather prevailing issue with today's smartphones, we just sort of expect metal backs to be less prone to accumulating smudges than ones made of glass.
It is mostly metal on the rear - the ALKALEIDO alloy we already mentioned - save for a strip along the bottom that is plastic. It's not really an eye-sore, and if you're positively inclined, it may even pass for a design accent.
The camera in the top left corner with a flash underneath it. The flash (still a single LED unit) is joined by a couple of sensors, one for laser autofocus, the other for measuring the color of the light in the scene for producing a more accurate white balance.
The curious sounding ALKALEIDO alloy is actually a trademark name belonging to the Japanese steel manufacturer Kobe Steel and our research showed it's a type of aluminum alloy.
Sony claims that they've chosen ALKALEIDO to complement their phone's premium design with a material, which has an extra shine and a feeling of depth.
Information is scarce though and the marketing materials don't say anything about its mechanical properties so we are really not sure what to expect of the durability of its finish.
We imagine it must have been a challenge to attain the water-proofing with all those different materials on board the device. And while we're on the subject, Sony warns you not to submerge the phone in water, and to avoid seawater, salt water (sea and ocean), and chlorinated water (pools), and points out that the warranty doesn't cover abuse and improper use. That's very much Apple's stance on the subject too, and Samsung simply says that you should stay within the boundaries of the IP rating.
Waterproofing is still a gray area with smartphones and we'd certainly advise against deliberately subjecting your phone to an environment that would test its ingress protection. Take it for what it is - a failsafe for when accidents happen.
Now, the Xperia XZ is still mostly a rectangle with sharp corners - some things will never change. If anything, the corners have gotten sharper.
The Galaxy S7 is meanwhile smaller in every dimension, though its display is, admittedly, 0.05 inches smaller in diagonal. Then, the LG G5 is a few millimeters larger at 149.9 x 73.9 x 7.7mm but you get a bit more screen real estate there. The HTC 10 is virtually the same as the Xperia XZ in footprint and its slightly higher thickness of 9 millimeters is offset by curves and chamfered sides.
The second count Sony might end up countering with a sequel to the UltraHD Xperia Z5 Premium - 1080p for the mainstream flagship, 2160p for that supposed Premium, and no 1440p at all. Makes sense.
Indeed, the XZ has a lot in common with the Z5. The display, for one, is the same size and resolution as the last generation - not necessarily a bad thing, but the XZ also comes with 3GB of RAM - modern-day flagships will crack a condescending smile seeing that in the spec sheet.
No one will laugh at the rest of it, though - top-of-the-line Snapdragon 820 chipset, 23MP camera with a trio of focusing technologies and 4K video recording (one could think the Z is required for that, had it not been for the M5), high-res 13MP front camera, Type-C connectivity, fingerprint reader, IP68 rating, stereo speakers - name one thing missing.
The 23MP primary camera of the Sony Xperia XZ is familiar from existing Sony high-end models, but in some aspect it's better than any of them.
As we already mentioned, this sensor was first used in the Xperia Z5. Later on, the same sensor was used in the Xperia X and the Xperia X Performance. It's also used now inside the XZ. You can read more about it in our dedicated article we published back when the Z5 came out.
The sensor is placed behind a 6-element lens with an ultra wide-angle 24mm-equivalent field-of-view and a f/2.0 aperture. These particular specs of the camera have not changed since the Xperia Z5.
The Xperia XZ uses Sony's latest camera UI. You change modes by swiping up and down (or left and right, if you're holding it in portrait). Superior Auto will probably be the main mode you use, only make sure you select the 23MP resolution - it's 8MP by default.
The Camera App tab holds some useful features and some features, which are just there for fun. Some of the available modes are Sweep Panorama, Slow-motion video, Face in picture, Sound Photo and a few more.
How do we go about this. To put it simply, the Xperia XZ's camera output is alright. It excels at resolving high-intricacy detail like foliage (and test charts) in good lighting, but with the sheer resolution of the 23MP images we'd be surprised if it didn't. All that detail, however, is mixed up with noise and noise reduction artifacts, which doesn't look good when pixel peeping.
Artificial light is when the dedicated RGBC-IR should help with white balance, and while it may very well be able to judge the color temperature perfectly, images still come colder than we'd like. Incandescent light in particular is rendered a lot cooler than the average person perceives with their eyes.
High-contrast situations can be handled in one of two ways. You can either shoot in Superior Auto and let the Xperia decide what's best for you, or you can switch to manual and flip the HDR toggle yourself. On the X Compact the dedicated HDR mode produced noticeably brighter images than Superior Auto - brighter overall, like positive exposure compensation. On the XZ the processing is much more restrained, and the results are more pleasing, but also practically the same as in Superior Auto - again, just stick to that. The thing is, without a live HDR preview you can never be sure what will come out in the end.
The Xperia XZ is equipped with a 13MP selfie camera, making it the highest-res front-facer on a big-name flagship - Sony gets it. It produces excellent images too, packed with detail and with good dynamic range. It does suffer in less than ideal light, though.
The Xperia XZ is the only model in Sony's current lineup to feature 4K video recording - largely a marketing decision, since the Xperia X, X Perfomance and X Compact all have the hardware to do it. Of course, you get the standard 1080p/30fps and high-speed 1080p/60fps options.
Why use 1080p when you have 4K? Certainly someone at Sony thought so, because FullHD footage is nothing spectacular. The Xperia X Compact we just reviewed produces noticeably more detailed 1080p videos. And with the limited field of view of 2160p capture, you may often end up having to resort to lower-res modes to get more in the frame, and end up disappointed by the difference in quality.
Rest easy, Xperia X Performance, the Xperia XZ will take it over from here. Sony's ultimate flagship this year has finally arrived (though we are still entertaining the thought of an X Premium).
It brings back Z-series essentials reimagined to fit into the top of the revamped X lineup - the blocky rectangular body is now clad in ALKALEIDO; the 5.2-inch display is the same size and resolution, only better; the camera has every known focusing tech built-in, and an extra color temperature sensor. How could all that not make a worthy upgrade to the Z5, good enough to make us stop lamenting the Z-series' demise?
Sony's pricing of its flagship actually makes some sense with the Xperia XZ, for a change. That's in part due to the Bluetooth wireless headphones that come bundled in a lot of markets if you pre-order the XZ. Priced at €200/£150, they bring the phone's price down to €500/£400, though simple math is not really how this works. What does tend to work, especially with Sony handsets, is price drops, so you might be wise to wait for a few months (though no headphones then).
Anyway, the rivals are clear - only the best will do. Let's start with the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, which is closer to the XZ in terms of price than the regular S7. With the S7 edge you get more screen real estate in mostly the same physical dimensions, and it's sharper too.
The curved Samsung flagship also has much longer battery life going for it, but its primary camera has half the pixels of the XZ's. Not to mention Samsung's 5MP front-facer - it's so two thousand and late, says the Xperia's 13MP selfie cam. The Type-C port of the Xperia joins the mock fest, only to be countered by the microUSB of the S7 edge that both adhere to the same USB 2.0 standard, and which type of cable do you have more of?
Well it does, sort of. It's a better phone than the Z5 in pretty much every respect, that's for sure. The greatest leap is perhaps in battery life, where the Z5 fared miserably once we adopted a specific brightness level for our battery tests. The display itself is also an improvement - visibly, and also measurably.
Time and time again, though, we can't get truly excited about a Sony camera. It may be equipped with every imaginable engineering breakthrough Sony could come up with, yet you'd be able to find more pleasing images if you look elsewhere. Try not to get us wrong on this one - it's not a bad camera, it's just not the best camera, and it still beats us why Sony, of all makers, can't make it the one.
A few caveats go with the above. For one, 2160p recording is a shooting mode all in itself, instead of being a setting in video recording. Digital stabilization is available, of the SteadyShot Standard type, but it appears that Sony uses the center 3,840x2,160 pixel portion of the sensor only, thus resulting in a severely narrower field of view, compared to still shots.
The 1080p/60fps mode also gets the SteadyShot Standard variety. In contrast, shooting in 1080p/30fps mode gives you the option between Standard and Intelligent Active. It's this last mode that gets the headline 5-axis stabilization (still digital), but only when recording close-up subjects.
Bit rates are 56Mbps for 4K, 30Mbps for 1080p/60fps and 17.5Mbps for 1080p/30fps. Audio is recorded in 156Kbps in all cases.
4K video is somewhat soft, but you can still read the gas prices on the gas station sign. There isn't much detail in the shadows, though. The footage is practically noise-free too, and looks really natural.
The other headline feature on the XZ is the triple-hybrid autofocus with laser assist being the new kid on the block joining phase and contrast detect. Laser works at close range and should be particularly useful in low light. Well, we experimented while shooting the test charts at the studio and the speed didn't blow our minds, despite the fact that it's a perfectly tailored scenario for the tech to shine.
In the past, Sony smartphone cameras have been plagued by lens issues, and we've observed the usual corner softness on the XZ, as well as on the X Compact. These two, however, seem particularly prone to lens flare with some examples shown below.
Stick to fit-to-screen magnification and you'd appreciate the good dynamic range and genuine color reproduction, particularly in natural light.
The selfie cam has pretty much the same features as the main camera aside from minor differences (the selfie cam's manual mode has no ISO selector or manual focus slider). It even reminds you to look at the camera lens when taking a photo.
Like other Xperias, the Xperia XZ's camera lets you capture moments in the blink of an eye - from a locked phone, it takes a mere 0.6 seconds to capture the first shot. To use that feature, you need to enable taking a photo when waking the camera with the shutter key in Settings.
There's a Manual mode too, which has gotten a few more features this time around. What was once just exposure compensation and white balance selectors, has now been expanded to include full range shutter speed selection (1/4000s - 1s) and a manual focus slider. The ISO setting is still tucked away in an extra settings menu, though.
Historically, flagship Xperias have had no optical image stabilization, and neither does the XZ. Sony's SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto has been upgraded, however, and now offers 5-axis image stabilization. We're not too comfortable with the term 'axis' that's become all too popular for describing what is a 'degree of freedom', but the point is that Sony's system is able to compensate for translation alongside two axes and rotation around all three. Or shift shake in the X and Y direction and yaw, pitch, and roll shake.
However, it only works in a narrow range of scenarios, when shooting video. It's activated in FullHD mode only, and when shooting close-up subjects. In cases, where both of these conditions don't apply, it's back to its usual 3-axis algorithm (pitch/yaw/roll).
That's not all that is new about the Xperia XZ's camera. While from the Z5 on high-end Xperias have had hybrid contrast/phase detection autofocus, the XZ adds laser autofocus to the mix, to help speed things up, by taking care of close-distance subjects and letting the other systems, well, focus on the rest of the focusing range.
But wait, there's more. Sony has also installed an RGBC-IR sensor (RedGreenBlueClear-InfraRed) to assist the image sensor in figuring out the color temperature of the ambient lighting, and adjust the white balance accordingly.
There's just one LED for the flash, though - no change there.
Introduced on the Xperia X, predictive autofocus is here as well. The idea is that you can tap on your subject and the camera will track its movement, keeping the focus locked on it. This is great for subjects who would move all around the scene such as a toddler or a pet.
The sensor isn't new - starting with the Z5, Xperias have used a multi-aspect 24.8MP sensor, now officially named as Sony IMX300. It is a custom sensor model, which is used only on Sony smartphones, and not supplied to other OEMs.
Depending on whether you shoot in 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio, different portions of the sensor are used and you get either 22.8MP or 20.1MP images, respectively, and never the full 24.8MP. Hence the official 23MP designation. Among the benefits of having such a multi-aspect sensor are the similar field of view in both modes (measured diagonally), and higher-res 16:9 shots than what you'd get by cropping from a regular 23MP sensor with a 4:3 aspect ratio.

"Sony may be done with the Z series, but the letter returns with the company’s latest addition to their flagship X range, with the Xperia XZ. Introduced alongside the much smaller Xperia X Compact at IFA a little over a month ago, this high-end smartphone is Sony’s attempt at finding a foothold once again in the competitive US market.
The Xperia XZ features a design that has been refreshed in a few different ways, but the general rectangular slab-like design language still makes it easily recognizable as a Sony smartphone. A combination of materials has gone into the build of this device, with glass up front, an all metal back plate, and plastic along its sides.
A few color variations of the Xperia XZ are available, with options including blue and silver, and as seen with this review unit, black. The black version comes with a satin-like finish, which isn’t particularly glossy, but does tend to be prone to fingerprints. That said, black also gives this phone a very sleek and stealthy look.
Taking a look around the device, the headphone jack and USB Type-C port are at the top and bottom respectively, a combined SIM card and microSD card slot is on the left, and finally, on the right side is the power button, volume rocker, and Sony’s signature dedicated camera shutter button.
The power button of the Xperia XZ does function as a fingerprint sensor, but that’s only true in other markets around the world, and unfortunately not the case in the US. For reasons unknown, Sony has decided to disable the scanner with the US version of the device, as the company did with previous Sony flagships as well. The keyword here is disable, and some developers have figured out a workaround that you can attempt at your own risk, if a fingerprint scanner is a must have.
he Sony Xperia XZ comes with a 5.2-inch IPS LCD display, with a Full HD resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 424 ppi. Quad HD is generally what is expected from current generation flagships, but unless you are planning to use the device for VR, you are not going to notice any difference with 1080p here.
Under the hood, the Xperia XZ packs a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, backed by the Adreno 530 GPU and 3 GB of RAM. While this is the processing package that is generally seen with most current flagships, 4 GB of RAM is the norm, so the reduction may be disappointing to some.
The Xperia XZ comes with 32 GB or 64 GB of on-board storage, but if you do opt for the lower storage option, you can bolster that with a microSD card by up to 256 GB. The US version of the device is a single SIM version, but there is also a dual SIM iteration available in some other markets, where users will have to make the choice between dual SIM capabilities and expandable storage.
Audio is a big part of the Xperia XZ experience. By plugging in a pair of headphones, you can take advantage of the device’s built-in support for Hi-Res audio files like FLAC, ALAC, DSD, and LPCM, and it can also upscale an compressed music files to give it more of a Hi-Res sound.
The Xperia XZ comes with a 2,900 mAh battery, with is a little smaller than a lot of other flagships out there. The battery is good enough to comfortably allow for a full day of use, but you won’t get a whole lot more beyond that. Even with heavy usage that involved a few hours of gaming every day, along with the usual activities that include social, email, and texting, the phone lasted for 12 hours off the charger, which is definitely not bad.
Sony is known for making really good camera sensors for smartphones, but they have unfortunately never managed to get the camera quite right with their own phones. However, there are a lot of improvements that have been made with the new sensor that the Xperia XZ is sporting. The device is sharing the same 23 MP rear camera as the smaller Xperia X Compact, and also comes with a 5-axis image stabilization, a new laser auto focus sensor, and a RGBC-IR that helps get the most accurate white balance, regardless of the lighting condition.
Where the Xperia XZ differs from its smaller sibling is when it comes to the front-facing camera, with the former coming with a 13 MP shooter, instead of the 5 MP front-facing unit of the Xperia X Compact. The front camera of the Xperia XZ allows for plenty of detail and color to be captured, and you also get a lot more flexibility with zooming into and cropping shots.
t is very quick and easy to launch the camera and take a shot, especially when using the dedicated camera key, and the pictures it takes are surprisingly very good. Images are extremely sharp and detailed, and it produces colors that are much more natural and true to life, but at the same time are stilll very pleasing to the eye.
In low light conditions, there is still a fair amount of detail to be had, and the images come out relatively noise free. The camera does to tend overexpose shots though, and there is a lot of blooming in the highlights. The camera can also be really slow to capture a picture poorly-lit situations, and if you aren’t holding the phone perfectly steady, you will end up with a lot of blurry shots.
On the software side of things, the Xperia XZ is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the Xperia UI on top, which Sony has scaled back significantly to keep the experience fairly light. You still have Sony’s own launcher, Settings menu, app icons, and a built-in themes engine, but the majority of the user interface feels very close to stock Android.
This integration goes up to the point where the Google Now second screen is now a part of the Xperia launcher as well. While the Xperia XZ is only available unlocked and free of network carrier bloatware, there are a few pre-installed applications to deal with, like AVG protection, Amazon Shopping, and Sony’s own list of apps. Overall however, this is a very clean and simple software experience, which is definitely a contributing factor to the smooth performance of the device.
If you are looking to get the Xperia XZ, the price is going to be something to contend with, with the device priced at $699. This puts it in the same price range as other flagships like the Galaxy S7 Edge and Google’s brand new Pixel smartphones, and there are also smartphones that offer flagship experiences at a fraction of the price, like the ZTE Axon 7 and the OnePlus 3.
So, there you have it for this in-depth review of the Sony Xperia XZ! It has to be admitted that I do really like this phone, and it has been a long time since a Sony smartphone has truly impressed me. The Xperia XZ has got a refreshing, new, and beautiful design which is still true to Sony, and also features a beautiful display, excellent performance, and a really great camera.
There is so much to like about this phone that I was able to forgive the lack of Quad HD display and a fingerprint sensor. However, with these features missing, the high price point might be harder to forgive. The Xperia XZ is undoubtedly the best smartphone that Sony has made in a long while, but if that is enough to justify paying a premium for it is up to you.
The predictive hybrid auto focus feature that Sony has been using a for a while now also works well for tracking moving objects and capturing them without motion blur. As long as the subject is moving at a reasonable speed, you’ll be able to get a crystal clear shot.
The rest of the camera experience is typically what has been available from Sony. The camera app is fairly simplistic, and navigating between Superior Auto, Manual, Video Recording, or switching to the front-facing camera can all be done by simply swiping on the screen. You also get the usual modes like AR Effect, Sweep Panorama, and Timeshift Video, that can be a lot of fun to play around with. The only quirk with Sony’s default camera app is that the HDR mode is still buried in the camera settings, and is only accessible when using the Manual mode.
A point to remember is that the 5-axis stabilization is purely software based, so there are no moving parts that are making this happen. This stabilization also kicks in only when you are recording close ups or macro shots, and in other situations, 3-axis stabilization is what you are getting. It does work extremely well though for video, and stabilizes the footage without any noticeable warping or distortion.
The phone comes with support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, which will allow you to get back to a full charge quickly. If you are running out of battery and can’t get to a charger easily, you do get Sony’s staple Stamina and Ultra Stamina modes that limit performance and certain functionality in favor of longer battery life.
Two small slits above and below the display house dual stereo front-facing speakers, which sound excellent, with no distortion even at the highest volume. However, when compared to something like the Nexus 6P, these speakers are no where near as loud, and don’t offer as much low-end punch.
Unlike the Xperia X Compact, the Xperia XZ does come with an IP 68 rating for resistance to dust and water, which means that you can use the phone in the rain or while in the shower if you want to, and it can also survive a dunk in the water with no adverse effect on functionality.
With a 1080p display, you’ll generally get much smoother game play and graphics performance when compared to Quad HD screens, because of the reduced strain on the GPU. Not surprisingly, the game play on the Xperia XZ is definitely extremely smooth, and there were no stutters or dropped frames that were noticeable with high-end games. Day to day operations including web browsing, opening apps, checking emails, and watching videos, have also been very smooth. Despite having 3 GB of RAM, I haven’t managed to slow this phone down with heavy amounts of multi-tasking either, so you certainly won’t feel the loss of an additional gig of RAM.
The screen is plenty sharp for comfortably reading text and web browsing, has excellent viewing angles, and is surprisingly very vibrant. Brightness is of no concern, and the display is easily view-able outdoors. You also have the usual white balance controls and Sony’s X-Reality engine built-in, that provide a sharper and more natural looking image when looking at photos and videos. There are also some benefits to having a lower resolution display, particularly in terms of performance and battery life.
As I also noted in the full review of the Xperia X Compact, the inclusion of a dedicated camera button provides a quick and easy way to get to the camera and is very convenient, but having all the buttons on the right makes the whole side feel quite cluttered. The placement of the volume rocker makes sense when considering its secondary use as a digital zoom control, but it is very awkward and uncomfortable to reach with your thumb when trying to adjust the volume in the portrait orientation.
The Xperia XZ comes with a 5.2-inch display, which allows for a relatively easy one-handed handling experience, despite the back plate being made with metal. Speaking of the metal backing, there are no plastic inserts to be found here, resulting in the NFC chip being moved from the back, where it is normally expected to be, to the front, next to the front-facing camera. This isn’t the first time that Sony has gone with this placement, but it does make tapping the phone to other devices or payment terminals just a little bit more awkward.
The phone comes with what Sony is calling a “loop” design. Basically, the sides are rounded and taper towards the front and back, which makes the transition between the different build materials feel more seamless, and also allows for a very comfortable feel when holding the phone. Sony has never had issues with build quality as far as their high-end offerings are concerned, and that remains true for the Xperia XZ as well, with the device feeling sturdy and substantial in the hand.
Hands on with the Sony Xperia XZ
With the company hoping to arrest their continuing fall in popularity, does their latest offering prove to be the answer? We find out, in this comprehensive Sony Xperia XZ review!

",http://www.androidauthority.com/sony-xperia-xz-review-714081/
"The Sony Xperia XZ may be the brand's fourth flagship in the last two years, but it's been a whole year since it released the Xperia Z5 to critical acclaim at IFA 2015.
The Xperia Z line is now dead. Every Sony phone will now be part of the Xperia X line, whether it's a budget, mid-range or high-end device, and will sit under the top-dog Xperia XZ – at least until we see the Xperia XZ 2.
Sony's Xperia XZ is now ready out in both the US and UK. It has a flagship price at $699.99 (£549, about AU$939) which is similar to what the Xperia Z5 cost when it launched. Now Sony has announced the newer Xperia XZs and the price of the Xperia XZ has dropped too.
This is a feature Sony has had on its flagship line for quite some time now. The Xperia XZ is IP68 water- and dust-resistant, so you can safely immerse it up to depths of one meter, although Sony advises against keeping it submerged for long periods of time.
The fingerprint scanner works quickly as soon as you hit the button. The position can be a little irritating if your phone is sat on a desk and you just want to turn it on though.
In terms of resolution, unlike competition from Samsung and HTC, the Xperia XZ is still only Full HD.
PS4 Remote Play is a big bonus if you're into your gaming too. If you have Sony's home gaming console you'll be able to play games on your Xperia XZ over the same Wi-Fi network your console is on – handy if someone else is watching the TV.
If you've used a Sony phone before, you'll recognize much of the design language that you'll find on the Xperia XZ.
The boxy design is still here, but it comes with slightly rounded-off edges, which enable the phone to sit in your hand comfortably. Out of all the Sony phones we've reviewed that feature a 5-inch-plus screen, this one feels the easiest to hold.
The top and bottom edges of the phone are flattened off, giving the Xperia XZ a look you won't find on other flagships. It reminds us of the Obi Worldphone MV1, but it's done with a high-end, premium feel which the Obi didn't have. Apart from enabling you to stand your phone up, though, this doesn't really offer much.
Sony is in the process of making its own Xperia user interface look and feel a little bit more like Google's stock Android platform. Compared to previous Sony phones, the interface on the Xperia XZ looks a little smoother than the normal Xperia UI, and that's a step most Android fans will appreciate.
The Xperia XZ runs Android 6 Marshmallow out of the box. It's a shame Sony didn't see fit to include the latest Android 7 software at launch, but you can now download the latest software to the phone. We've yet to test out Android 7 on the Xperia XZ, but we plan to update this review very soon with details of how the new software works.
The Sony Xperia XZ's Full HD screen is bright and quite large, making this a great choice if you're looking for a phone to watch a lot of movies and TV on.
The top volume does feel a little stunted compared to some other flagship phones. It's certainly not as loud as the Galaxy S7 or the HTC 10.
We'll talk more about gaming in the following section – but the Xperia XZ will be able to handle any games you want to play on it. We experimented with all types of games, including Pokemon Go, Reigns and Real Racing 3, and none of them stuttered.
It features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset – which is one of the best on the market right now – working in tandem with 3GB of RAM. You may see some phones with 4GB or 6GB of RAM on board, but 3GB does the job nicely here.
Battery life on the Xperia XZ isn't going to blow your mind, but it's going to last you through the average day – as long as any other flagship phone in 2016 – and most users will be happy with that.
By the end of the day it generally had between 10% and 30% of its charge left – one night it was bedtime before we got the 30% battery notification, although you won't have that much juice left at such a late hour if you're going to be intensively using your phone.
For when you're away from the charger, there's Sony's Stamina power-saving mode. This disables background data and GPS when the screen is off, as well as image enhancement and vibrations.
We put the Xperia XZ through the TechRadar battery test – running a 90-minute clip with the screen at maximum brightness and accounts syncing over Wi-Fi in the background – and it had 74% left at the end. That makes sense, as the Xperia Z5, which has the same 2900mAh cell, completed the test with 75% remaining.
Sony is pushing the camera as the headline feature of the Xperia XZ – but you wouldn't be blamed for wondering what's new here when looking at the spec list.
The only real highlight comes in the form of laser autofocus, which works in tandem with the predictive hybrid autofocus of previous Sony phones.
And the Xperia XZ delivers. All the shots like this that we took showed minimum blur. If you examine the photo above, you can make out every element of the shot clearly apart from the right foot.
We've never used a phone with autofocus this fast and accurate.
In terms of regular photography, you're going to get some great-looking shots out of the Xperia XZ using the auto mode.
Selfie shooting is improved on the Xperia XZ too. There's a 13MP front-facing camera here, which rivals some of the more impressive Chinese handsets designed to let you indulge your narcissistic tendencies.
You can capture Full HD video on the front-facing camera too, meaning that video calls will look as good as you'll ever need them to.
The Xperia XZ doesn't represent a revolutionary step from Sony. Rather it's a repackaging of the highlights we've seen in previous Xperia handsets, with a refined design and a few more tweaks to keep up with the competition.
If you currently have an Xperia Z5, there isn't much reason to upgrade here. It's fairly similar to last year's Sony flagship, and there's no compelling headline feature to turn your head.
And if you're using an older Android phone from another brand, the Xperia XZ could be a great choice as well. The Android competition right now is tough – as you'll see in the Competition section below – but the Xperia XZ holds its own against some of the best phones you can buy right now.
You should buy the Xperia XZ if you're upgrading from an older Sony phone and want the best package the brand currently offers. It doesn't have the high-end screen spec you'd get on the Samsung Galaxy S7.
If you live in the US, the Xperia XZ won't come with a fingerprint sensor either and that's something you'd expect to get on an expensive flagship phone.
The Xperia XZ is a great phone, just be warned – there isn't that much that's new in the Xperia XZ and it is pricey. If you were to go out and buy a Xperia Z5 you would get most of what's here, but just not in such a full package.
That said, the Xperia XZ is a complete-package flagship phone that we've wanted from Sony for quite some time.
If you're considering the Sony Xperia XZ, here are the other phones you might want to consider, both from Sony and rival brands…
The real highlights of the Xperia XZ come in the form of the new and improved design - with waterproofing, yet again - as well as little tweaks to the camera.
New autofocus technology on the Xperia XZ allows you to get some phenomenal moving shots with the rear shooter on the back of the phone and it's incredible what Sony has been able to achieve with its 23MP sensor.
With a top of the range speedy processor, 3GB of RAM and improved software the Xperia XZ will allow you to do whatever you want on your phone with ease.
If, however, you currently own an Xperia Z3+ or an older Sony phone, and like the way it looks and works, this is the phone to go for as an upgrade. The Xperia X and Xperia X Compact offer up premium spec, but the Xperia XZ is by far the best of the bunch.
It would have been nice to see a 2K display on the Xperia XZ, but Sony knows best what its batteries are capable of, and has stuck to Full HD.
The design tweaks give the XZ a more premium feel phone than previous high-end Xperias, and it seems that Sony may have finally nailed what a flagship phone should look and feel like.
This is certainly one of the best phones you can buy for selfies right now – the level of detail impressed us, and it'll impress your social media acquaintances too.
The sensor delivered fantastic images in our testing, with sharp detail and bright colors. There's also a new 'wave to capture' mode, which enables you to balance your phone on a wall or other surface, then step and take a photo without having to touch a button.
It won't give you as vibrant an image as the iPhone 7, or as sharp a shot as the Galaxy S7. Some shots we took appeared a little washed-out in the background, but the autofocus knew what object we wanted to focus on.
According to Sony, white balance accuracy has been improved on the Xperia XZ. While it wasn't particularly noticeable when taking photos on the phone, comparing images to ones shot on the Xperia Z5 on a computer screen revealed that color fidelity on the Xperia XZ has improved by quite some way.
Then there are the manual mode options on the Xperia XZ. If you're willing to delve into these settings and experiment, you can enjoy some of the best mobile photography possible on the Xperia XZ.
Sony's camera also features optical image stabilization, and records video in 4K. We found video quality to be impressive, but 4K is of limited use considering the screen on this device is only Full HD.
You could move the video files across to your 4K TV for viewing at full resolution, but remember these files are going to be huge, and will take up a lot of room on your phone.
Sony is positioning this as the phone to go for if you like to take action shots and other snaps of moving subjects. The marketing for the Xperia XZ features images of dogs jumping in the air, so we tried to recreate those shots with TechRadar's Home Ents writer Jon Porter…
The Xperia XZ comes with a 23MP rear camera, which is the same size sensor we've seen before, and has a maximum aperture of f/2.0 and an LED flash – again, specs we've seen before.
Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, with its 3600mAh battery, that's quite poor – the S7 Edge only dropped 14% of its battery in the same test. And it's especially poor when you consider that the Xperia XZ only has a Full HD screen, and not a 2K display.
The Xperia XZ won't stun you with its battery life, then, but it will see you through a day of moderate use, and will hopefully last longer over time than the Xperia Z5 and many other Android phones.
If you're waiting on an important phone call you can always use the Ultra Stamina mode – this only allows access to the phone and basic apps such as contacts, messages and camera.
Sony has included its own fast-charging tech in the Xperia XZ, so it won't take too long to charge up when you need it to either.
The Xperia XZ can also learn when and for how long you charge your phone – the aim here is to ensure your phone isn't being pummeled with lots of charge when it's not needed.
For example, if you charge your phone overnight and you wake up at 7AM, your XZ will charge up to 90%, then cut off charging until around 6:50AM, then finish off the charge in the last few minutes before you wake up.
Sony wants to help you optimize battery performance over the lifetime of the phone, and this will help – it's a welcome feature if you're planning on hanging on to your XZ for a few years.
The Xperia Z5 series phones weren't the best in terms battery life, but they weren't the worst either – and it's a similar story here.
We've already touched on gaming performance, and no apps crashed during our time with the phone either – that happened fairly often with the Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Premium. 
Plus there's the added benefit of PS4 Remote Play, which is a major bonus for anyone who owns both Sony's ultimate home gaming console and an Xperia smartphone – and this is one of the few phones you can currently use for Remote Play.
Sony has included its own Audio app, which enables you to integrate Spotify streaming. It's more likely you'll use the normal Spotify or Google Play Music apps though, and both of these are included on the Xperia XZ out of the box.
You may find storage a bit of an issue – the Xperia XZ comes with 32GB as standard and there's no larger-capacity model, and it's not too hard to fill up 32GB given that Android takes up 10GB before you add any apps, music or movies.
But it shouldn't be too much of an issue with 256GB of microSD space available – if you're going to pack this phone full of media, just be sure to get yourself a large microSD card.
Sony has included its Movies application for playing movies and videos, and this provides a TV programming schedule too. Google Play Movies and TV is also on the phone.
The speakers on the Xperia XZ are okay, but they're not improved upon from previous phones. Although the stereo effect can be good when you're watching films, we did struggle to hear the phone sometimes when playing audio.
The Xperia XZ didn't crash under any usage scenarios during our review period – it seems to be a fully reliable phone, unlike the Xperia Z5 proved to be. Playing games such as Real Racing 3 and Reigns proved that the XZ is well capable of handling high-end gaming – more about that later.
There were a few occasions when apps loaded slowly, but so far we haven't had any significant problems with the XZ.
That said, there is still a heavy overlay from Sony – for example, all your main apps, such as Messages, Phone and Contacts, are designed with Sony's own look.
Sony has also included a number of its own apps, including PlayStation, Xperia Lounge and Movie Creator. The best Sony-made app, PS4 Remote Play, is missing though, so you'll have to download it from the Google Play Store.
There's a touch of bloatware too, in the form of Amazon, Kobo and AVG apps, but these can be deleted if you particularly dislike them, or need the space.
On the top is a 3.5mm headphone jack (take note if you're a disgruntled iPhone fan) – it's in a good place for plugging in headphones when your phone's in your pocket.
There's a new kind of metal material on the back of the phone, which Sony calls ALKALEIDO, although you won't notice anything radically different about it – to the touch it feels much the same as the metal on previous Sony handsets.
It does feel premium, though, and it looks better than the glass on early Xperia Z-line handsets. But be warned: it may be a new kind of material, but the Xperia XZ will still pick up your greasy fingerprints.
The only issue here is that the screen on the Xperia XZ is a little too small for playing games on a regular basis – for that we'd recommend picking up an Xperia Z4 Tablet with its 2K 10-inch screen.
You'll also need to make sure your Wi-Fi connection is up to handling PS4 Remote Play.
The screen is bright and looks good though - it's not 2K, but that's likely not a deal breaker or a reason to not buy the Xperia XZ. If you want to experience VR with your phone, it may not be the best choice as it only offers 424 pixels-per-inch compared to 534ppi on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.
For those situations you can just use the on screen unlock pattern or pin, so it's not a major issue.
Those who are left handed may also find it a little more difficult and will need to register a different finger to get the benefit of unlocking it in the hand.
There's a 5.2-inch screen on the Xperia XZ, which may feel a little large for those with smaller hands. This is an average size screen for flagship smartphones right now, but you should note you'll likely need to use both hands to reach all the edges.
Dust-resistance, meanwhile, ensures that if you take your phone to the beach sand isn't going to get jammed in the sockets and ports.
This is impressive, considering that both the 3.5mm headphone jack and the USB-C slot at the bottom of the phone are open; despite it being a feature of Sony flagship phones for quite some time, the waterproof design is still something worth shouting about.
For most markets, Sony has included a fingerprint scanner on the side of the phone to make easy to unlock, yet secure. However, buyers in the US don't get the scanner.
When TechRadar asked Sony's Senior Director of Marketing why this was, he told us: ""It was a business decision we needed to make in order to transition [in the US] from the carrier market to the unlocked market.""
That answer isn't entirely clear, and it's a big shame that customers in the US won't get this security tech included on their Xperia XZ.
The scanner is built into the power button on the right-hand side of the phone, and is in a great position for your thumb when unlocking your device.
In the UK you can now buy the Xperia XZ for around £450, while those in the US can get the phone for $470. There's still no word of an Australia release at the moment.
It's the best of the best of Sony's mobile tech in one full package. It features all the highlights of Sony phones we've seen the past, put into a melting pot and blended to create something familiar, yet different.
If this was an iPhone, it would be an S iteration. There are small improvements to the design, camera and battery tech – but there's no big, headline feature or major difference when you compare it to the Xperia Z5.
On the iPhone 7, for example, the headline feature was the introduction of a water-resistant build – but Sony has been there and done that, waterproofing its flagships since the Xperia Z back in 2012.
Instead it's a reworking of the highlights from the last few years – and that's not necessarily a bad thing.
In the meantime Sony has released the Xperia X, which we believed to be its latest flagship handset at the time – but it wasn't. The Xperia XZ is that phone.

"La gama Xperia de Sony es muy amplia, aunque para 2016 la marca japonesa lo apuesta casi todo a su nuevo tope de gama, el Xperia XZ. Presentado en la IFA de Berlín, es un móvil de gama alta que quiere competir de tú a tú con los mejores del año.
Sus credenciales son las habituales en todos los Xperia: un diseño con líneas rectas y una buena cámara, al menos en teoría. ¿Será suficiente? Para decidirlo, hemos probado y elaborado un análisis completo del Sony Xperia XZ.
Por características, tiene poco que envidiarle cualquier otro móvil. Sin embargo, las especificaciones de un móvil no lo son todo, y eso lo sabe bien Sony. Las sensaciones tras usar su flagship son un tanto agridulces, con demasiadas luces y sombras para lo que se esperaba de él.
Con el mercado móvil cada vez más competitivo, Sony tiene aquí una oportunidad para posicionarse bien de cara a 2017. Una empresa de este tamaño quiere y necesita tener un flagship entre los mejores, aunque de momento la mayoría de los Xperia no han terminado de brillar como se merece un histórico como la marca japonesa. ¿Lo conseguirá con este Xperia XZ? Te lo contamos.
El aspecto del Sony Xperia XZ se mantiene muy en la línea de todos los smartphones de la compañía. Es rectangular y con mucha línea recta, a diferencia de la tendencia general del sector. No cuenta con botones físicos en la parte frontal, sólo los de cámara, volumen y apagado en el lateral derecho. Sus dimensiones exactas son 146 x 72 x 8,1 mm y 161 g de peso.
De estos botones hay que decir varias cosas. La primera de ellas es que no están situados en el lugar habitual que ocupan en el resto de móviles Android. Los de volumen están justo debajo del de apagado y encendido. En un primer momento esto puede generar una opinión negativa del Xperia XZ, pero una vez que te acostumbras, se trata de una posición muy ergonómica. El de Home, además de para desbloquearlo, hace las veces de lector de huellas.
Por su parte, el botón de cámara sirve para activar la app correspondiente, así como para enfocar y disparar. Los móviles Sony tienen vocación fotográfica, de ahí que este disparador no haya desaparecido. Es especialmente útil si te gusta hacer fotografías, pero poco más.
El mejor móvil de Sony para 2016 cuenta con dos altavoces en la parte frontal: uno en la zona superior y otro en la inferior. Para reproducir música está bien, pero tiene un claro inconveniente: hace que el cuerpo del móvil sea bastante más grande de lo que debería, si tenemos en cuenta el tamaño de su pantalla. Da la sensación de que el fabricante podría haber diseñado un smartphone mucho más compacto apurando algo más los bordes superior e inferior.
El material utilizado para el cuerpo unibody del XZ es metal ALKALEIDO. Al tacto, este metal recuerda, tal vez demasidado, al plástico. El borde exterior sí que transmite sensación metálica, pero no así la tapa trasera. De hecho, ésta es todo un imán para las huellas. Al menos no es especialmente resbaladizo, una característica cada vez más común.
Otro argumento a favor que no podemos pasar por alto en esta review del Sony Xperia XZ es su certificación IP68. Es sumergible, para que nos entendamos. Quizás esto tenga algo que ver con el diseño, y es que no es lo mismo fabricar y ensamblar un móvil para que resista al polvo que hacerlo completamente estanco. En este caso es sumergible durante media hora a metro y medio de profundidad.
Si durante el análisis del Sony Xperia XZ hemos encontrado una característica sorprendente, es su pantalla. Las pretensiones del fabricante son destacar en otros aspectos, como la cámara y el diseño; aun así es el panel lo que verdaderamente llama la atención. Hablamos de un IPS LCD de 5,2 pulgadas con resolución Full HD 1080p y 2.5D, es decir, ligeramente curvo en los laterales, aunque quizás estas especificaciones no dicen demasiado.
La opinión que nos merece la pantalla del nuevo Xperia es realmente buena. Además de ser muy luminosa -lo que permite una perfecta visibilidad en cualquier circunstancia y ángulo de visión-, la calidad del color es indiscutible. La diferencia se nota incluso comparando este móvil con otros de características parecidas.
Las dos tecnologías responsables del rendimiento del panel son la pantalla Triluminos y el Motor X-Reality. Ambas están ya presentes no sólo en el último móvil de Sony, sino también en todos sus nuevos televisores y monitores. Hay que reconocer el esfuerzo a los japoneses, y es que con esta nueva generación de pantallas casi se ponen a la altura de las Super AMOLED de Samsung.
La experiencia de visualización es de las mejores que se pueden encontrar hoy por hoy en un móvil, y eso es algo verdaderamente remarcable.
La respuesta táctil también es inmejorable, aunque no se puede esperar menos de un terminal que aspira a colarse entre los mejores móviles de 2016. Quizás más puntos por pulgada, ya que con “sólo” 424 se queda algo lejos de la considerada mejor pantalla de smartphone, la del Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, que cuenta con 534.
Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow es el firmware del XZ, y la verdad es que se le saca todo el partido posible. La optimización es buena, lo que repercute positivamente tanto en el rendimiento como en la autonomía de la batería.
Si se le puede poner alguna pega, tiene que ver con la gran cantidad de bloatware y aplicaciones preinstaladas que Sony inserta en sus terminales. Además, el aspecto de la capa de personalización es un poco antiguo para lo que se estila en Android hoy en día. Está en las antípodas del minimalismo de las ROM AOSP de Android o de las capas de personalización de los móviles chinos.
Por ejemplo, Sony incluye varias aplicaciones de dudosa utilidad y que, en cualquier caso, prestan un servicio para el que ya existen otras alternativas. Movie Creator, Xperia Lounge, Noticias, Teclado Swiftkey o el antivirus AVG Protection son sólo algunos ejemplos. Si a los usuarios les molesta estrenar un móvil y que ya venga sobrecargado de aplicaciones, Sony no parece haberse dado por enterada.
Este punto puede ser un problema si no amplías su capacidad mediante una tarjeta Micro SD. Si no lo haces, entre el software del teléfono y las contadas aplicaciones y archivos que descargues, el espacio ocupado se puede ir a más del 70% fácilmente.
La capa de personalización de Android utilizada por la firma japonesa también peca de falta de usabilidad en varios aspectos. No se pueden añadir teléfonos a la lista negra ni bloquearlos. La galería tiene un aspecto que recuerda a las versiones de Android de hace años. Es muy poco intuitiva y en ocasiones desesperante.
Una de las apuestas de Sony es la posición del lector de huellas. Situado en el botón de Power del lateral derecho, facilita el desbloqueo y lo hace mucho más cómodo y ergonómico, aunque en más ocasiones de la cuenta se niega a reconocer la huella dactilar. Otra pega que se le puede poner es que la pantalla no se activa al poner el dedo sobre el lector, una opción que más fabricantes deberían empezar a considerar.
El Sony Xperia XZ no escatima en potencia y gráficos
Durante la prueba del Sony Xperia XZ no hemos notado ralentización o sufrido cuelgues del sistema ni una sola vez. Es un punto a su favor, y hay que dejarlo claro. Con este móvil podrás utilizar cualquier aplicación o juego sin problemas.
El rendimiento está asegurado, ya que con un Snapdragon 820 de cuatro núcleos, GPU Adreno 530 y 3GB de RAM no hay proceso que se le resista. Dicho esto, también hay que aclarar que destaca especialmente entre los móviles que equipan esta configuración, algo que ha marcado la diferencia a lo largo de esta review del Xperia XZ.
Se puede afirmar sin medias tintas que es un buen móvil tanto para usuarios básicos como para los que quieran jugar a los últimos lanzamientos. Además, se calienta poco, y esto habla bien de la optimización del software y el sistema operativo. La disipación del calor es un problema cada vez más acuciante en casi todos los móviles, con procesadores cada día más potentes. Sin embargo, no es el caso del XZ, que rinde sorprendentemente bien a la hora de refrigerar sus componentes.
Aunque habrá quien pueda pensar que 3 GB de RAM son pocos, realmente no es así. Son suficientes para no pasar apuros en ningún caso. Sony no ha entrado en la escalada de especificaciones que llevan a otras marcas a planear ya móviles con 8 GB de RAM.
Sin embargo, es inevitable establecer una comparativa entre el Sony Xperia XZ y sus competidores. Cualquier análisis que se precie debe hacerlo, aunque no a ojo. Para eso existen aplicaciones específicas de benchmark, que miden y cuantifican el rendimiento de un móvil en distintas situaciones. Para este smartphones hemos usado AnTuTu, la más popular, y GFXBench, 3D Bench y GeekBench.
Todas ellas deberían servir para hacerse una idea de cómo de buen móvil es el Xperia más potente del mercado. También se pueden poner ejemplos: Asphalt 8 y Modern Combat 5, dos de los juegos con mejores gráficos, se ejecutan a la perfección y sin pizca de lag.
Sony Xperia XZ merece una valoración especialmente sobresaliente en el apartado gráfico en 3D, consiguiendo procesar casi los mismos frames por segundo que dispositivos considerados punteros. Con estos datos y sensaciones en la mano, no queda más que afirmar que estamos ante uno de los smartphones más potentes y con mejores gráficos, ya sea para jugar o para ejecutar otras acciones.
Sony quería que situar la cámara de su tope de gama como una de las mejores del mercado. Si lo ha conseguido o no, es bastante cuestionable por varios motivos. El primero de ellos es la cantidad de tiempo que se toma la aplicación para almacenar las fotos en la galería. Varios segundos, en muchas ocasiones, lo que impide que la visualices de forma inmediata.
Sabemos de sobra que más megapíxeles no significan mejores fotos, sólo mayor resolución. Por eso otros fabricantes innovan en otros aspectos, como la cámara dual. Para el Xperia XZ, Sony se ha mantenido en sus trece y se va a los 23 MP en la cámara principal y 13 en la de selfies, con Sensor Exmor RS f 1/2,3"" y gran angular de 23mm en el caso de la primera.
El inconveniente de aumentar hasta el límite la resolución de las fotografías es que el peso del archivo se dispara. Si te compras un móvil como el XZ para hacer fotos, se hace imprescindible una buena Micro SD, o pasarás apuros con el espacio de almacenamiento.
El resultado de las fotos es cuestionable, sobre todo debido a la ausencia de estabilizador de imagen, sólo presente a la hora de grabar vídeo. Esto provoca que casi todas las fotos salgan movidas en los extremos alejados del foco. No vas a tener más remedio que llevar contigo un trípode o trabajar un pulso de hierro.
Pasa el ratón por encima de la imagen para ver las diferencias
Los dos modos principales son el manual y el automático superior. En el segundo de ellos, el software de la cámara reconoce automáticamente la escena y le aplica el modo que más le convenga, mientras que en el manual no. En él puedes elegir el modo, dejarlo en automático o modificar otros parámetros.
El tiempo de exposición es manipulable. Si quieres sacar fotos de objetos que se mueven a gran velocidad, es un ajuste que resulta muy útil. Para comprobarlo, hemos comparado la misma foto hecha a una fuente en modo automático superior y en modo manual. La diferencia no se aprecia, aunque se nota mayor nitidez en el modo manual cuando amplías bastante la instantánea.
De noche, la calidad de las fotos baja más de lo que debería. Cuenta con flash y flash de relleno, aunque la diferencia se nota muy poco en distancias cortas. Precisamente cuando tratas de enfocar objetos cercanos, se notan algunas dificultades para dotar a la instantánea de profundidad de campo.
Eso sí, sin estabilizador cuesta bastante hacer una buena foto de forma casual, en especial si tienes problemas a la hora de mantener el móvil a pulso. Puede llegar a ser desesperante, lo que convierte a Xperia XZ en una buena cámara que podría dar mucho más de sí.
Y otra cosa más: los 23 MP te sirven si te conformas con imágenes en 4:3. Para sacarlas en 16:9 tendrás que reducir la resolución a 20 MP. Aun así, es más que suficiente y apenas se nota la diferencia. A la cámara de un móvil de gama alta se le debe exigir mucho más que un buen puñado de megapíxeles.
Como contrapunto a esta opinión ciertamente crítica de la cámara del Sony Xperia XZ, hay que decir en su favor que capta el movimiento y los colores realmente bien y de forma intensa y que enfoca con sorprendente rapidez. Es uno de los puntos de los que Sony más se enorgullece, y hace bien en hacerlo.
Por su parte, la cámara frontal para selfies tiene 13 MP, más que la mayoría de cámaras principales, aunque repite los mismos errores que su hermana mayor. Sí, tiene muchos modos y opciones, como el HDR o el Modo Nocturno, pero sólo puedes usarlos en modo manual si bajas la resolución a 8 MP.
El vídeo llega hasta los 4K, aunque no aparezca en las opciones aportadas por el software de la cámara sino como un modo aparte. El vídeo en 2K sí es mucho más accesible, aunque sólo a 30 fps. Para grabar en 60 fps tienes que reducir su resolución hasta 1080p, cifra que tampoco está nada mal. Aquí sí se hace presente el estabilizador de imagen, probablemente la mayor desventaja encontrada en la review del Xperia XZ.
En cuanto al estabilizador, una de las apuestas de Sony, hay que decir que efectivamente permite grabar vídeo de forma nítida sin trípode ni apoyo artificial de otro tipo. La cámara de este smartphone también logra captar con éxito el movimiento, de forma fluida y transmitiendo una sensación de naturalidad que otros móviles no logran.
2.900 mAh de batería alumbran la autonomía de este smartphone. Es una cifra bastante aceptable y bien optimizada. Con el brillo al máximo la batería del Xperia XZ te dará aproximadamente un día de autonomía, bastante más si eliges uno de los modos economizadores de batería o si le bajas el brillo al panel.
La pantalla es muy luminosa, y ya sabemos que este apartado del hardware es el que más batería consume. En el Xperia no es necesario tener el brillo al máximo, a no ser que estés a plena luz del día. Si lo reduces, conseguirás arañar algunas horas más sin que la experiencia de usuario de empobrezca demasiado.
Para hacer un análisis de la duración de la batería del Xperia XZ, lo hemos puesto a reproducir vídeo en streaming HD a través de Youtube. El resultado: 45% de gasto tras dos horas de reproducción. Teniendo en cuenta la luminosidad de la pantalla, no está nada mal. Por ejemplo, el Xiaomi Mi 5 se deja un 60% en el mismo test.
Si lo que quieres es estirar hasta los dos días de autonomía, el software del teléfono da la opción de activar el Modo Stamina. Viene a ser el equivalente al Ahorro de Batería de la mayoría de los dispositivos Android, aunque en este caso, ofrece modificar cómo de ahorrativo quieres ser con el consumo. Stamina Ultra desactiva las aplicaciones prescindibles, por lo que es recomendable sólo para emergencias.
La Quick Charge 3.0 es hoy en día prácticamente irrenunciable en un móvil de gama alta, aunque en este apartado Sony decepciona. Casi hora y media se toma para cargar el 50% de su batería y casi dos y media para una carga completa, bastante más de lo deseable. Además la compañía no incluye el cargador necesario para la carga rápida en el paquete del móvil.
Con un uso normal, de redes sociales y aplicaciones de mensajería, su autonomía no sufre deterioro. No es así si usas ciertas aplicaciones, como por ejemplo la cámara. En apenas media hora sacando fotos, la batería se deja hasta un 30% de su capacidad. Mucho cuidado a la hora de salir de casa sin un cargador encima.
Nada falla en conectividad, ni siquiera la Dual SIM
Al igual que en el resto de apartados, las características del Sony Xperia XZ en cuanto a conectividad lo colocan entre los mejores. No le falta casi de nada, y es que además del obvio 4G LTE tiene Bluetooth 4.2, WiFi Dual, NFC y USB Tipo C 1.0, aunque no tiene Radio FM, una ausencia cada vez más común.
No se echa en falta nada que tengan otros móviles del mismo rango de precio. Se pueden hacer pagos con el móvil y el USB Tipo C permite la carga rápida, aunque en el paquete no se incluye este tipo de cargador. Por lo demás, la velocidad de conexión es inmejorable y el sonido estéreo que proporcionan sus dos altavoces también es bastante nítido.
Al estar situados en la zona frontal, el sonido en manos libres es oye bien en casi cualquier circunstancias. Algo parecido ocurre con el chip NFC, colocado justo a la izquierda de la cámara de selfies.
Si hay que destacar algo más, sin duda es la tarjeta SIM Dual, que permite tener dos líneas activas simultáneamente. Una de las ranuras se puede utilizar para ampliar su capacidad de almacenamiento en 256 GB, además de los 32 o 64 que de almacenamiento interno. Un detalle positivo de Sony es que la bandeja de las SIM es extraíble sin necesidad de utilizar un pin, aunque esto atañe más al diseño que a la conectividad.
La conexión a Internet es todo lo veloz que cabría esperar de un móvil de gama alta. No hay apenas diferencias con otros que tienen 4G de última generación.
El XZ es un buen intento de la marca japonesa por mantener un pie en la gama alta. Sin embargo, por varios motivos sabe a poco y parece insuficiente. Aunque es un móvil muy potente, presenta algunas carencias que son difíciles de justificar a estas alturas. La principal es la ausencia de estabilizador óptico en la cámara de fotos.
Cierto es que es un smartphone que sirve prácticamente para todo, con una buena pantalla y un diseño que a gran parte del público puede parecerle atractivo, aunque es cuestión de gustos. La SIM Dual es una característica interesante, que podría impulsar una buena opinión del Sony Xperia XZ tras la review, pero permite pasar por alto otros problemas, como la lentitud de la carga rápida.
El precio del Sony Xperia XZ tiene un precio de unos 699€ en España. Sin duda es un teléfono que merece la pena a cualquier tipo de usuario, pero cuyo coste podría haber sido más ajustado. Al final, ningún teléfono es difícil hacer un análisis pormenorizado sin comparar, este Xperia sufre y mucho en comparación con los principales tope de gama del mercado.
