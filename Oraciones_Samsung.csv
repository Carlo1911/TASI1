 or Rogers in Canada  with Snapdragon 835 processors and Sony IMX camera sensors,['camera']
2 inches  which makes it a bit taller and slightly wider  with a battery 16  larger,['battery']
 The corners curve  the display curves  the glass curves,['display']
 This is a phone that has no sharp corners  nowhere to focus our attention away from the massive screen,['screen']
2 inch QHD  display  but both use Samsung s latest AMOLED panels  at a 2960x1440 resolution,['display']
 The larger of the two  the S8   is a little less amenable to single paw use  but it s still far narrower than something like the Pixel XL  and has far more usable screen real estate,['screen']
  Even though wide angle video is cut off  though some apps make minor crops to fill the display   the tradeoff is worth it,['display']
 As good as the LCD panel is on the LG G6  Samsung practically owns the OLED space  and it s becoming clear that the thinner display technology is the future of mobile screens,['display']
 That screen   the so called Infinity Display   is not a huge departure from something like the Galaxy S7 s edge  but it eliminates as much of the bezels above and below the display as possible,"['screen', 'display', 'display']"
 Samsung did it  in part  because it finally removed the home button from the front of the phone  adopting on screen navigation buttons for the first time in its history,['screen']
 So there s no physical home button  just three on screen navigation keys,['screen']
 The achievement comes in the form of an  invisible  home button  a tactile area below the on screen home button that offers real feedback from a precise haptic engine,['screen']
 Not only does this alleviate some of the angst around losing that physical key  but it allows you to turn on the screen as you would that physical counterpart by pressing at any time   even when the display is off,"['screen', 'display']"
 Now on the back  right next to the camera  it s not quite as bad as it looks   especially on the smaller S8   but it s still not great,['camera']
 And while I wish Samsung would have thrown symmetry to the wind and placed it center  below the camera  I found myself only using the fingerprint sensor when the face recognition wasn t feasible,['camera']
1mm  perfectly suited for a modest  but not huge  battery  and the complete elimination of a camera bump,"['battery', 'camera']"
   Aside from the bevy of sensors aligning the narrow strip of bezel atop the display  the only other major change to the Galaxy S8 s design is the addition of an extra button on the left side of the phone,['display']
 You ll likely see more companies release phones of this shape  size and aspect ratio this year  but none will be able to offer an AMOLED screen of this caliber  HDR certification  DCI P3 color gamut  with a flexible display and curved glass that isn t just a gimmick  well  mostly isn t a gimmick ,"['screen', 'display']"
 That said  Samsung s new launcher is pretty great  with a gesture friendly home screen that does a lot with a little,['screen']
 Part of that willingness to accept is thanks to Samsung s beautiful  simple Infinity live wallpapers  which assign gently shifting scenes of the cosmos to the home screen  lock screen and always on display,"['screen', 'screen', 'display']"
 Together  they form a blanket of subtle movement to the phone s curved exterior  and play well with the form  from the gradual lightening when turning on the screen to the way the stars move when shifting home screens,['screen']
 You can turn on the display by tapping the area where the virtual home button lives and have the phone automatically scan your face or iris,['display']
  I guess the question I would ask is  Would you prefer Samsung have maintained the front facing home button finger sensor combo and sacrificed the scale and symmetry of the new Infinity Display  After using the phone for two weeks   after maneuvering my left or right index finger to find the awkwardly placed fingerprint sensor next to the rear camera   I think the decision is not only justifiable  but agreeable,"['display', 'camera']"
 From calendar entries to recent photos to upcoming Uber rides  Bixby Home is located to the left of the main home screen  and available anytime  thanks to its button   it amounts to a watered down version of Google Now s Feed,['screen']
 Bixby Vision  A way to identify and purchase products using your camera  this is one of the more interesting and potential filled parts of Bixby  but as of now it s fairly limited,['camera']
 Apps that aren t optimized for the Galaxy S8 s taller aspect ratio can be forced to conform   my default email app  Newton  saw no ill effects   and Samsung has taken it upon itself to optimize YouTube for the larger display  intelligently cropping content so it fills the entire 18,['display']
5 9 screen,['screen']
 And popular features from previous Galaxy devices make a return here  too  Smart Stay  which debuted on the Galaxy S3  is still chugging along  while Samsung s retinue of display scaling options have been maintained from the Galaxy S7 Nougat update,['display']
  There is a new set of always on display options  replete with what Samsung is calling FaceWidgets  a trio of swipeable widgets  from music controls to a tiny schedule  that can be accessed by double tapping on the perennially visible clock,['display']
 Of course  both versions of the phone come with Edge screen support this time  and while they re on by default  I find most of the options of dubious value and quickly turned them off,['screen']
 Still  as with the Galaxy S7 edge  a helpful screenshot annotation feature is now built into the Edge screen  allowing you to take a square or circle screenshot  or even a short video that s saved as a GIF  as you work on the phone,['screen']
 Finally  a number of battery saving features are on board  including a default resolution of 2220x1080  another holdover from the Galaxy S7 s Nougat update,['battery']
 This absolutely contributed to the excellent battery life I got from both the Galaxy S8 and S8   but I want to be clear about the decision  it s almost impossible to tell the difference between 1080p and the phone s default resolution of 2960x1440  even at the most eye straining scale,['battery']
 I did eventually switch to a different launcher  Nova Launcher   and I did disable a number of what I feel are superfluous features  including the Edge screen and FaceWidgets  but the good news is that I am pretty damn happy with the way Samsung has restrained its propensity for feature bloat   or bloat of any kind  in fact,['screen']
 This is the first phone on the market with Qualcomm s Snapdragon 835 platform  which once again sees its flagship chip adorned with eight cores  along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of UFS 2,['ram']
1 based storage,['storage']
  The Snapdragon 835 also drives the Galaxy S8 s improved camera experience  with an updated image signal processor that delivers cleaner photos in low light  and smoother implementations of multi frame captures like HDR,"['camera', 'processor']"
  Efficiency seems to be the Snapdragon 835 s defining characteristic  and that extends to the battery life,['battery']
 If you skipped through the previous 4 000 words to find out whether the Galaxy S8 and S8  have improved battery life over their predecessors  I have good news,['battery']
  Both phone sizes have roughly the same sized battery cells as their 2016 equivalents   3 000mAh for the Galaxy S8  and 3 500mAh for the Galaxy S8 ,['battery']
 But both are convincingly better at lasting a full day of use  largely owing to the more efficient processor  a Super AMOLED screen that  pixel for pixel uses less power  and a lower default resolution that appeases both previous points,"['processor', 'screen']"
5 or 5 hours of screen on time,['screen']
5 hours of screen on time,['screen']
 But for a couple of days where I was heavily engaging the phone  I didn t have to top up at all during the day  and usually went to bed around midnight at 20  battery  after taking it off the charger at 7am,['battery']
0 standard  in addition to fast wireless charging over both Qi or PMA  battery life is notably improved over the Galaxy S7 series,['battery']
  Samsung purposefully didn t push the battery capacity of the two S8 models because it feels that the Snapdragon 835 brings additive efficiencies  and because it doesn t want to take a risk on a cavalier new battery design,"['battery', 'battery']"
 Even without HDR  Samsung now uses a feature new to the phone s upgraded image signal processor called multi frame processing  which uses the faster  wider memory bus to seamlessly capture multiple photos every time you press the shutter button to come up with cleaner  more accurate photos,"['processor', 'memory']"
 Much of Samsung s camera legacy of the last few years has been defined by this tendency towards hyper sharp  overly saturated scenes  and this is the company moving away from that,['camera']
 That s not to say colors are muted  or approach the level of pure canonical reproduction  but with Samsung s screens now DCI P3 compliant and largely calibrated for accuracy  it makes sense that the camera would be similarly tuned So is the camera better than the Pixel  our current champion  I don t think so  at least not in absolute terms,"['camera', 'camera']"
 What is better than the Pixel is the camera app s opening speed  which is astoundingly fast  and the camera app itself  which has been revamped to make finding and using manual controls much faster,"['camera', 'camera']"
  Remember the old days when Samsung would fill every free pixel with some gimmicky feature that you would never use  Thankfully  the company s newfound minimalism extends to the excellent camera app  which now features a handy zoom gesture attached to the shutter button,['camera']
  Even the built in camera effects  stolen guiltlessly from Snapchat  are well done,['camera']
  Unlike some of the other substantive hardware improvements  the Galaxy S8 s rear camera is another solid effort  but not more,['camera']
 Other than screen dimensions and battery size  the Galaxy S8 and S8  are identical,"['screen', 'battery']"
 It s just nicer to have that extra few hours of battery  and the additional screen real estate is a bonus,"['battery', 'screen']"
 Samsung has maintained so many of the features that  in retrospect  endeared the Galaxy S7 series to millions of people   waterproofing  a microSD card slot  a great low light camera   that it was very careful about what to change,['camera']
  The most obvious change is that screen  which is astoundingly good  and the banishment of the fingerprint sensor to the back,['screen']
  The subtle changes to the software  too  are mainly a complement to the screen,['screen']
 Every design decision  it seems  is in some way in service of this screen  which is big and beautiful and colorful and curved,['screen']
  If you re not a fan of that curved screen  you re out of luck,['screen']
Huge screen that takes advantage almost all the frontal absence of physical navigation buttons very measured dimensions even in the Samsung Galaxy S8 I think it has been the best evolution,['screen']
The S8 which is noticeably larger does not hinder its use with a limb despite the 6 2-inch screen,['screen']
From behind it changes with respect to previous Galaxy the fingerprint sensor so close to the camera has turned out to be little intuitive,['camera']
Nevertheless the unlocking of the screen is fast,['screen']
Zero lags almost instant opening of apps default animations somewhat slow flowing games like water And a vibrant screen that transmits quality,['screen']
Edge edges of which we can not escape two models with curved screen I think it is an error they maintain the same essence as in previous models,['screen']
Includes professional camera interface and a multitude of creative ways to get more juice out of photographic capabilities,['camera']
 Then came the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus  two phones that push the boundaries further than ever before  but do they offer enough   In previous years  Samsung s Galaxy S flagship s  would almost certainly be the best phones of the year  but this year LG  Huawei  and Sony have all bought their very best to the market  and Samsun The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus continue Samsung s recent penchant of combining outstanding smartphone design with an excellent display to create an all around fantastic experience,['display']
 The switch to the taller display has allowed Samsung to cram even more screen real estate into its new smartphones and in doing so  the company is setting the new standard for big screen devices,"['display', 'screen', 'screen']"
 Think back to what a big screen phone meant a couple of years ago and compare it to the Galaxy S8 and it s clear that the future is much brighter  and we re now closer than ever to phone that is all display,"['screen', 'display']"
  For the all around big screen experience  Samsung has knocked it out of the park and while the likes of LG and Huawei definitely come close  the design of the Galaxy S8 means it stands tall above the competition,['screen']
 There s two sizes to the Galaxy S8 but neither comes with an Edge moniker  with Samsung calling its taller curved screens the Infinity Display,['display']
 The focus with this year s phones isn t the curved display however  but more so how Samsung has managed to squeeze so much screen real estate into the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus,"['display', 'screen']"
8 inch display inside the Galaxy S8 comes inside a body that s slightly taller but narrower than the Galaxy S7  148,['display']
6 mm  despite a screen that s 0,['screen']
 The added screen real estate sees a bump in the weight as well  at 155 grams and 173 grams respectively  but this helps the Galaxy S8 feel more premium in the hand,['screen']
 The back is where Samsung has made arguably the worst design decision on the Galaxy S8  removing the home button means Samsung had to find a place for the fingerprint sensor and they chose to combine it with the heart rate monitor next to the rear camera,['camera']
 While other OEMs have chosen to put fingerprint sensors in the center of the device  Samsung s decision means it can have its logo right underneath the camera  but as a result  the fingerprint sensor is cumbersome to use,['camera']
 As you ll often be fumbling blindly to find the fingerprint sensor  you may end up with fingerprints on the camera lens itself  so Samsung has included a reminder when you launch the camera to wipe it down,"['camera', 'camera']"
  Thanks to a taller screen  the removal of the home button  and bezels that are slimmer than ever  Samsung has managed to put a bigger screen in a footprint that s barely bigger than last year,"['screen', 'screen']"
  All of this leads to what we ve come to expect from Samsung displays   an extremely vivid Super AMOLED display that punches colors harder than before and is a joy to use,['display']
 Rated as one of the first HDR capable smartphones  the Galaxy S8 screen ups the brightness and color saturation of the screen when viewing content like YouTube and apps that support HDR  such as Netflix,"['screen', 'screen']"
5 9 aspect ratio means Samsung has managed to pack more pixels into its display  with the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus both offering displays at 2960 x 1440 pixels,['display']
   The additional pixels mean a taller display overall  but there is some pillar boxing when watching widescreen content so you ll have black bars on the sides,['display']
 You might find the bars distracting for most media content  but you can force apps to full screen mode either through the display settings menu or by tapping the icon in the recent apps menu,"['screen', 'display']"
  Out of the box  both phones come with the display scaled down to Full HD   but you can tweak this and things like color saturation in the display settings,"['display', 'display']"
 The removal of the home button means a switch to soft keys  but Samsung has included a pressure sensitive area near the bottom of the display which vibrates when pressed hard enough and can be used for unlocking the phone when it s asleep,['display']
 On screen keys allow you to swap the position of the  recent apps  and  back  keys  but unlike with other manufacturers  there s no option to add an additional key for the notification menu,['screen']
 Running the Galaxy S8 display through our testing  we found the screen has a max brightness of 373 nits with auto brightness turned off and 515 nits with it turned on,"['display', 'screen']"
 During sunlight we found a visible punch in the brightness and although the display isn t technically the brightest  it is definitely pleasing to the eye,['display']
 With a color accuracy of 7180 Kelvin  the Galaxy S8 doesn t have the most accurate display in its default out of the box state  and has a warm tone  but with all of these effects turned off  the display is the closest we ve come to the ideal temperature of 6500K with a temperature of 6440K,"['display', 'display']"
 Overall  the addition of so much real estate is a more than welcome trade off to Samsung removing the home button and much of the experience remains the same otherwise  including the Edge UX and Always On Display  which have a couple of actionable additions,['display']
 Depending on your market  you can either expect the latest Exynos 10nm chipset or the Snapdragon 835  both coupled with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of on board storage  which is expandable via a microSD card,"['ram', 'storage']"
  As you might expect  the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus come equipped with a heavy hardware stack which includes expandable storage  a 32 bit audio DAC  dual band Wi Fi  and a plethora of connectivity options,['storage']
 Personally  I think the company has played it a little safe with the battery capacity inside its new flagships  in a bid to prevent any issues with the battery,"['battery', 'battery']"
 This means the Galaxy S8 battery is the same size as the Galaxy S7  while the Galaxy S8 Plus is slightly smaller than the 3 600 mAh battery found inside the Galaxy S7 Edge,"['battery', 'battery']"
 Over the past two weeks  the Galaxy S8 battery life has proven to be on par with most flagships  but not spectacular,['battery']
 During an average 18 hour work day  the Galaxy S8 offered around 4 hours of screen on time for Josh  and on occasion  this stretched to five hours,['screen']
 In comparison  the battery life for me offered around 3,['battery']
5 to 4 hours of screen on time from a 14  to 18 hour work day,['screen']
 TouchWiz gives you lots of different power saving features and combined with the Super AMOLED display  you can stretch out the battery life even further,"['display', 'battery']"
 As mentioned before  our time with the Galaxy S8 Plus has been limited  so we re not able to comment on the battery life yet,['battery']
 However  we ll be publishing the results of our battery testing for both phones in the coming week,['battery']
 From real world usage with the regular Galaxy S8  it s clear that the battery life will vary according to your usage  but we seldom had to top the phone up before bedtime,['battery']
 Samsung has refined its camera over the past few generations of its phones to produce what is arguably the all around best smartphone camera on the market,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The Galaxy S8 camera may not be heavily changed from the Note 7  and even the Galaxy S7 Edge before it  but enhancements in the overall picture taking experience mean Samsung s legacy of high quality photography continues,['camera']
 In low light  the pictures lose some sharpness as the shutter requires more time  but this is expected  especially from a camera that lacks image stabilization,['camera']
  The main camera is a 12 MP shooter with large dual pixels  f 1,['camera']
 There are no new modes in the camera  though there is the addition of 1080p recording at 60 frames per seconds for smooth video recording,['camera']
 Samsung touts that the camera has multi frame processing  which means it takes multiple shots of the same image and puts them together to get the best colors and detail from a scene,['camera']
 The camera isn t the most accurate   Samsung devices never produce the most accurate photos   but the bump in saturation and detail mean the photos look more appealing to the eye compared to other phones,['camera']
  The only real difference in the camera UI is the addition of a small eye icon in the bottom left of the viewfinder  which fires up the biggest addition to the camera  and the phone itself  Bixby,"['camera', 'camera']"
 We ll start with Bixby Vision  which manifests itself in the camera through the little eye icon,['camera']
 Tapping this fires up Bixby Vision  which brings augmented reality to the camera in a bid to provide information in real time  based on the objects in the viewfinder,['camera']
But the fires blazes and airline warnings acted as guillotine for a phone that if not for its conflicting battery would have been crowned as the best of 2016,['battery']
There was no other if Samsung wanted to make room for the great and incredible screen they have assembled,['screen']
One side effect of this location is the dirt that collects the lens of the camera,['camera']
It is very easy to confuse the fingerprint reader with the camera and therefore dirty the lens,['camera']
Fortunately the Galaxy S8 remembers when opening the camera application that we must clean the lens to obtain the best results of the camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
There was no other if Samsung wanted to make room for the great and incredible screen they have assembled,['screen']
One side effect of this location is the dirt that collects the lens of the camera,['camera']
It is very easy to confuse the fingerprint reader with the camera and therefore dirty the lens,['camera']
Fortunately the Galaxy S8 remembers when opening the camera application that we must clean the lens to obtain the best results of the camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
The front of the Galaxy S8 is almost entirely screen,['screen']
It also offers the possibility of adapting a video to occupy the entire screen but in turn cuts part of the scene up and down,['screen']
It is recommended to enable this mode. It depends on the type of content being displayed on the screen,['screen']
Its display now covers the entire color space DCI P3 features HDR technology achieves a higher brightness level and maintains both pixel density and the excellent contrast ratio of previous phones,['display']
The result is an almost perfect display,['display']
On the screen of the Galaxy S8 an image can look very contrasted and vibrant but in reality it is nothing more than a mirage created by the phone,['screen']
Screen Modes To counteract the lack of precision and surrealism of the image represented by the Samsung S8 offers a number of image modes in the application settings,['screen']
What happens with the screen is played to a lesser extent with the Galaxy S8 camera,"['screen', 'camera']"
Despite the belief of many the camera of the Galaxy S8 itself is different from that of its predecessor,['camera']
It is significantly better than the software that controls the camera,['camera']
It is probably the best camera of the moment,['camera']
The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are practically the same the only difference is in the price screen size and size of battery that supposedly goes according to the screen size although I am sure that the Galaxy S8 battery will still last longer than the Galaxy S8 already good in itself,"['screen', 'battery', 'screen', 'battery']"
Specifications of the Samsung Galaxy S8 The Samsung Galaxy S8 hardly have differences with the Galaxy S8 here you can see them but the specifications are more or less the same except those small nuances in the screen and battery,"['screen', 'battery']"
5 8 Infinity Display Curved display on both sides,"['display', 'display']"
Integrates a blue light filter and Always On Display technology,['display']
Samsung Exynos 8895 processor with 8 cores at 2 3 GHz,['processor']
4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage that can be extended with a microSD,"['ram', 'storage']"
12MP Dual Pixel Rear Camera and 8MP Front Camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
Compatible with QC 2 compatible 3000 mAh battery,['battery']
But what is clear just see them is that it assembles the best technologies in the market both in camera and in power where its Exynos and its screen are going to be one of the best tricks to buy the Galaxy S8,"['camera', 'screen']"
This year Samsung has put all the meat on the grill and has created a very thin device with a curved screen less curved than before that really improves the design but without much use and has polished the edges so that the terminal is melted into one,['screen']
No more grip on the Edge screen or touching the screen with your hands unintentionally,"['screen', 'screen']"
If you have a small hand it will cost you to reach the top of the screen and you may have to use your other limb,['screen']
In the front part we see almost every screen where the lower part of it has a zone with force touch that allows to unlock the terminal without pushing buttons,['screen']
At the top is the front camera the sensor to recognize your iris and also the speaker that this year has gotten in and is very well protected from any type of scratch in addition to not damage the visual style of the phone with some type of protuberance,['camera']
As for the rear we have a new Dual Pixel camera that reminds us of the previous Galaxy because it is very similar but still does not stand out although it has a protective ring that prevents the lens from being damaged,['camera']
The design is really good without a doubt the mobile is going to like a lot but you have to know that you are before a mobile with a curved screen and that means that you have to escape the falls or you could damage,['screen']
After talking about the design one must comment One of the things that most worries the users is the camera of the Galaxy S8,['camera']
To understand the improvements with respect to the Galaxy S7 we have to talk about the front camera and the rear camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
Firstly the rear camera is very similar but the camera software has been optimized and improved so that the photos are even better,"['camera', 'camera']"
We have shredded the full camera of the Galaxy S8,['camera']
Here you can see how step-by-step the application of the camera of the Galaxy S8,['camera']
The camera carries a 12 MP Dual Pixel sensor in my case signed by Samsung an ISOCELL sensor f 1,['camera']
So you can see the actual performance of the camera in different environments something that most reviews do not show,['camera']
The photos are a bit better than those of the Galaxy S7 but where it really is the advance part of the software is in the front camera,['camera']
In addition to the design performance and autonomy of which we will talk Samsung has improved something that for years left a little behind its competitors the front camera,['camera']
Yes a camera for selfies that will do some brutal photos and that is capable of recording in 4K although in this option without optical stabilizer,['camera']
How you stay A front camera that surpasses everything we had seen in Samsung and other brands achieving impressive results,['camera']
As for the rear camera up to Samsung will remind you to clean the lens because with the bad situation of the fingerprint reader is likely to rub with your finger more than once,['camera']
After marveling at the design and the camera comes the time to talk about something that worries the performance and the battery,"['camera', 'battery']"
The mobile flies thanks to the increase to 4 GB of RAM and those 64 GB of storage come from pearls not to fill the mobile and start suffering,"['ram', 'storage']"
There are no performance issues but there are no battery problems either.,['battery']
The battery of the Galaxy S8 offers a duration similar to that of its namesake last year,['battery']
This means that if you see our battery tests of the Galaxy S8 you will realize that the battery can withstand up to 7 hours of screen in the base version more or less the same as the Galaxy S7 at the beginning or Maybe a little more,"['battery', 'battery', 'screen']"
If the mobile with the most powerful processor on the market can not yet any other would do,['processor']
And yes the battery is so good that for people who use less the screen performance will be far superior to the Galaxy S7 because the mobile on hold does not spend anything its processor is very but very efficient and more if you have the Exynos version that is sold in Europe,"['battery', 'screen', 'processor']"
The screen added value And lastly we will not leave without mentioning your screen,"['screen', 'screen']"
It's awesome is the best screen I've seen on a mobile and it's not because it's the one I bought,['screen']
What I liked the Galaxy S8 most perfect screen,['screen']
Camera the front is impressive and the back a bit better than the old S7,['camera']
Battery could be better but with this capacity withstand what they throw without problem 2 days of autonomy with normal use,['battery']
What I liked least about the Galaxy S8 The fingerprint sensor could be under the screen or centered on the back does not end up liking me,['screen']
The screen is a little elongated and that makes you have to get used to using it and some applications do not work full screen,"['screen', 'screen']"
The Good The best looking phone around crushes it in performance  battery life  water resistance and wireless charging,['battery']
 An external storage slot lets you keep more photos  videos and music,['storage']
  The Bad Its awkwardly placed fingerprint reader leads to camera smears and longer unlock times  which is aggravating when you use it to unlock your phone dozens of times a day,['camera']
  The Bottom Line The Samsung Galaxy S8 s fast speeds and fantastic curved screen make it a top phone for 2017  but the annoying fingerprint reader could sour your experience,['screen']
 It s been helping restore buyers  confidence after the double Note 7 battery disaster  the S8 s apparently selling like hotcakes   and it s a chance to cement the Samsung name as the top Android brand against upcoming rivals  the pure Android Google  Pixel 2   squeezable HTC U11 and cut price OnePlus 5,['battery']
  And the screen  5,['screen']
8 inches of colorful gorgeousness with a display that stretches from edge to edge with just a whisper of a bezel,['display']
 Plus  the G6 s second camera takes wide angle photos,['camera']
  To go a little deeper  read this  Galaxy S8 versus LG G6  Which is the smarter buy   Samsung Galaxy S7  The S8 is far sexier  with a larger screen,['screen']
 Unless you ve gotta have the latest and greatest hardware specs and the S8 s curved screen lusciousness  there s no pressing need to upgrade,['screen']
is case  I can boil it down to the awkwardly placed fingerprint reader    you will curse this    and the still up in the air Bixby AI software  which combines Siri  Google Now and a camera add on,['camera']
  Also  while photo quality is great  it s weird to me that Samsung  usually so on top of trends  opted for one camera lens on the back instead of two,['camera']
  So far  the battery has made the S8 warm  like most phones get  but not dangerously hot,['battery']
 Hopefully Samsung s new eight point battery test has done its job keeping all future handsets combustion free  unlike the poor Note 7,['battery']
 The battery reserves have lasted a good  long time  but I m keeping an eye on idle drain as the months march on ,['battery']
 So long as you aren t hanging all your hopes on work in progress Bixby  Google Assistant is an easy alternative to invoke  and have the patience of a saint when unlocking the phone  the Galaxy S8 is a sound buy that will make your friends jealous of its tall  curved  crazy elegant screen,['screen']
 And if your current phone isn t yet on its last legs  it doesn t hurt to wait and see how the S8 s battery continues to fare in the wild,['battery']
     Top level controls in the native camera app s manual mode are easy to access  so that s good     The sides of some games and apps cut off when you go full screen  Clash of Clans is one example      I m not loving the jerky scrolling on the Recents tab     If you use a third party app to remap the Bixby button  like Bixby Remapper   you might notice lag using it Not to be dramatic  but the Galaxy S8 really is a feast for the eyes,"['camera', 'screen']"
 Extremely slim bezels mean there s much more screen stuffed into the shape  83 percent of the phone s face is all yours for tapping and viewing,['screen']
  The S8 is the first standard Galaxy S phone  as in  not an Edge or Edge Plus  to have curved sides and the Edge display,['display']
 You can use it as a kind of speed dial for your frequent apps and contacts  news headlines and so on  which you can call up from any screen  and tweak the tab location so it s easy for you to grab ,['screen']
  Oh  one more thing about the screen,['screen']
 It s a very high resolution  2 960x1 440 pixel display  and that makes text  images and video absolutely pop  even in direct sunlight,['display']
 You should know  though  that the off standard dimension means you ll have to either be cool with black bars on the sides of videos you play  called pillarboxing   or you ll need to tap a screen control to crop to fit,['screen']
 The S8 falters when you give it the finger print   My biggest problem with the phone design is the fingerprint reader  which moved from the home button on the S7 s front face to a narrow strip on its backing that looks a lot like a Tic Tac  just left of the camera mount,['camera']
 Other rear mounted fingerprint sensors  such as the LG G6 and Google Pixel  are closer to the middle center of the phone s body  well clear of the camera and flash,['camera']
  Muscle memory has somewhat taken over and I ve grown more used to the placement,['memory']
 And yes  I did often smear the camera with finger grease  yum  on the way to the scanner,['camera']
 It ll start off by only working with phone settings  such as vocally dimming the screen  turning on Wi Fi  rotating a picture and so on,['screen']
  Finally  Bixby Vision is a camera filter like Google Goggles or Bing Vision on a throwback Nokia Lumia,['camera']
 No dual camera  and that s  mostly  OK  Standard photos on the Galaxy S8 s single 12 megapixel are consistently good,['camera']
