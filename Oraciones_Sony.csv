2 inch  1080p resolution LCD display covered in Gorilla Glass 4,['display']
 The display is boosted by software technologies such as Triluminos and X Reality to maximize its color and brightness and make it deliver punchier colors,['display']
 The Sony Xperia XZ is powered by the ubiquitous Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset that features a quad core processor  up to 2,['processor']
 Sony has decided to showcase its camera department s best work with the Xperia XZ  for the smartphone comes with a 23MP main camera powered by a custom Sony IMX300 imaging sensor,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The camera has an f 2,['camera']
 On the front  there s a 13MP camera with a 1 3 inch sensor  which is larger than those traditionally used in front cameras,['camera']
 Despite its 23MP camera  the Xperia XZ might have a hard time standing out,['camera']
 A 2900mAh battery runs the system with support for Quick Charge and a bespoke battery preservation tech that sees the smartphone stop charging at 90  and finish the rest of the battery slower as to prevent the cells from damage,"['battery', 'battery', 'battery']"
2 inch Full HD display  1080 x 1920 pixels  of an IPS LCD kind,['display']
  Triluminous    X Reality   Sony does not shy away from throwing in a bunch of pompous marketing names to convince everyone in the superior qualities of this screen,['screen']
 Most top shelf phones in 2016 come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 system chip  and the Sony Xperia XZ is no exception  we have the 820 with 3GB of RAM here,['ram']
 The main camera on the Xperia XZ features a custom made Sony IMX300 sensor of 1 2,['camera']
 Up front  the Xperia XZ is equipped with a 13 megapixel camera,['camera']
 Then  there is the fact that the Xperia XZ has a 23 megapixel camera  but its default Superior Auto captures 8MP images,['camera']
 We ve already walked you through the counter intuitive way to switch to 4K video  you can t record 4K video in the  video  mode  you have to swipe up to the camera apps  and select 4K from there  and we ve already told you that it takes forever to switch to 4K video and the interface is absolutely contrary to intuitive,['camera']
 The Sony Xperia XZ features a non removable 2 900 mAh battery,['battery']
 However what most users will be really interested in is actual battery life in daily use,['battery']
 Another interesting thing we test is charge times  how much does it take to fully recharge the phone from 0 to 100  using the wall charger and cable provided in the box  So there you have it  the Sony Xperia XZ scores in the middle of the pack in terms of battery life  and it is annoyingly slow to recharge,['battery']
 However  there are just so many places where it falls short  especially compared to the strong competition  its display features bluish and not properly balanced colors  it sometimes stutters  it has a fairly scarce 20GB of user available storage space  its camera is slow and often counter intuitive  with images and videos that are not on the same level as the ones from iPhones and Galaxies  it lacks quick charging and in the United States it even ships without a fingerprint scanner,"['display', 'storage', 'camera']"
  For  50 less  you can get the excellent Apple iPhone 7 that delivers the same waterproofing  but also an exquisite body  an amazing camera and outstanding  smooth performance,['camera']
 For  100 less  you can get the also superior Galaxy S7 with its more compact design and excellent camera,['camera']
 With nightly charges  what happens is that the battery remains plugged in long after it s fully charged and this continuous trickle charge is stressful to a battery cell and makes it degrade faster,"['battery', 'battery']"
 Sony s clever trick here is that it learns that you usually wake up at  say  7am  and it would stop charging the battery at night when it reaches around 90   and will only resume charging closer to your wake up time,['battery']
 This way  you still wake up with a fully charged battery  but the damage from excessive charging is avoided,['battery']
  All of this hopefully should mean that battery health will remain excellent in the long run  but for users looking for the daily charging results  the score is really nothing to write home about,['battery']
  That s why we put it through its paces in our standardized battery test that puts all phones on equal playing ground  we set their screens at 200 nits of brightness  a level comfortable for indoor use  and run a custom script that measures typical phone use with no off screen time,"['battery', 'screen']"
 While not outstanding  the Xperia XZ battery still lasted longer than the one on the LG G5 and Nexus 5X  but less than the battery of the iPhone 6s,"['battery', 'battery']"
 Sony is also proud of its tracking auto focus feature and here is how it works  tap on a moving object on your screen and the phone will automatically lock the focus on it and track it as it moves,['screen']
 It won t track small objects  for instance  and with Sony s super wide angle camera  most objects appear small unless you zoom in,['camera']
  When it comes to the front camera  we re content with it  but again  we don t find it to be extraordinary,['camera']
 So in conclusion  yes  the Xperia XZ is a feature packed camera  but rather than that being a plus  it ends up making it overcomplicated and far from intuitive,['camera']
  In terms of special sauce for the main camera  Sony brings in an additional laser AF that helps lock focus faster  and also a color sensor that helps the phone properly set the white balance of an image,['camera']
  The Sony camera app is a worthy subject of a separate discussion  as it has so many peculiarities that it s hard to sum them up in a few sentences,['camera']
 Yet  the Xperia XZ does support 4K capture  but you need to scroll further up to camera apps  and only then select 4K video  These are all things that are far from intuitive,['camera']
    The lock screen Image  1 of 21 Yes  we have the same old Sony skin on top of Android 6 Marshmallow here  and there are two things to keep in mind  first  the Sony skin is rather simple  but also without much of a special sauce  it starts to feel a bit bland  and secondly  given that the XZ will launch in the same time as Android 7 Nougat  we can see how many would be annoyed  rightfully  for not having the latest version of Google s platform,['screen']
  We are not very happy with a few of the basic features of the XZ  particularly  the on screen keyboard,['screen']
2  Full HD display is sharp enough so that most users won t see pixelization,['display']
 We find no issue with it  hence  no reason to complain about it not being a Quad HD display,['display']
 To be perfectly exact  there is one scenario when a Quad HD display would actually be more beneficial  if you mount your phone in a VR headset  you can actually see a real difference in sharpness there,['display']
  At the same time  if you are not particularly picky about color accuracy  the screen is not terrible  again  colors are unrealistic  but they also  pop  more and the screen gets sufficiently bright to be comfortable to use in various conditions,"['screen', 'screen']"
  Up front  there is a beautifully laminated screen with Gorilla Glass 4  yet others are already using the tougher Gorilla Glass 5  that uses on screen Android navigation keys,"['screen', 'screen']"
 The new Sony Xperia XZ is probably the biggest update to the series with a brand new  loop  design that changes the appearance of the phone  but even this does not make it a very significant change  yes  it has a slightly larger screen and a slightly larger battery than the X Performance  but the specs and software are nearly identical,"['screen', 'battery']"
  Under the hood  the Sony Xperia XZ features the same top shelf Snapdragon 820 system chip  with 3GB of RAM on board and the base version of the handset has 32GB of internal storage  expandable via microSD cards,"['ram', 'storage']"
 Sony has  however  improved the camera with a 23 megapixel sensor with 5 axis software stabilization and laser auto focus that speeds up focusing,['camera']
Sony s latest flagship  the Xperia Z6 comes with refined design  improved camera  and a due update in specs,['camera']
 We re yet to see tangible proof that the RAM race leads to actual usability benefits  but if people were to reason that way  the industry would sit still,['ram']
 That said  it does show that on the XZ designers did more than move around the front camera and sensors,['camera']
 In terms of space management  the Xperia XZ is typical Sony   ample bezels all around  but especially above and below the display,['display']
 We appreciate the two stage manual shutter button  but increasingly more so for its ability to launch the camera super quickly and less as an actual shutter release,['camera']
 We ve already grown accustomed to taking pictures with tapping  but more importantly  exercising force on the small physical button often results in slightly misaligned shots and camera shake on such small devices where you can t get a steady grip  as opposed to an actual digicam ,['camera']
 Sony is confident it nailed the flagship display size and resolution with the Xperia Z2 and has been sticking with it ever since  now including the Xperia XZ,['display']
2 inch FullHD display means a density of 424ppi  which is plenty sharp,['display']
 The display posted very good scores across the board with the only exception of color accuracy,['display']
 The Xperia XZ relies on a 2 900mAh battery to keep it powered,['battery']
 The technology allows the phone to monitor the cell s electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit s lifespan,['battery']
 So what does Battery Care do  Say you charge your phone overnight  and you regularly plug it in at midnight and unplug it at 8 in the morning,['battery']
 In time  the phone will recognize the pattern  charge the battery to 90  and then stop charging,['battery']
 Enable that and it s back to basics where you get a single homescreen with access to the dialer and contacts  text messages  camera  clock   just the basics,['camera']
 The big stuff  like the proprietary Stamina battery saving modes and the home baked multimedia apps are here as well,['battery']
 This includes the swipe down gesture  which shows a screen of the apps you use most along with recommendations for new apps to install,['screen']
 You can re arrange the quick toggle tiles and adjust the screen brightness,['screen']
 The iPhone 7 breezes through this test thanks to a combination of powerful GPU and low screen resolution,['screen']
 This includes network storage so that you can view photos from a DLNA server  your home computer  for one ,['storage']
 What sets the XZ apart from all of this year s top dogs  not exactly in a good way either  is the 3GB of RAM   the rest of the big names have gone with 4GB  with the OnePlus 3 having 6GB of RAM  though it s not actually using all of it actively ,"['ram', 'ram']"
  RAM shouldn t have much of an effect on GeekBench scores   a CPU focused benchmark  and yet the Xperia XZ doesn t fare quite as well as the rest of its peers,['ram']
  Smart cleaner frees up memory of both kinds   Sony Xperia XZ review Smart cleaner frees up memory of both kinds   Sony Xperia XZ review Smart cleaner frees up memory of both kinds   Sony Xperia XZ review Smart cleaner frees up memory of both kinds   Sony Xperia XZ review  Smart cleaner frees up memory of both kinds  Sony has a proprietary backup solution built in on its latest Xperias,"['memory', 'memory', 'memory', 'memory', 'memory']"
 There isn t screen pinning either like we had on the Xperia X Performance   apparently  not a very popular feature  as we haven t seen it since,['screen']
  On the software side of things  there s Sony s Stamina battery saving feature,['battery']
  Qnovo claims the battery should last hundreds of charge cycles more than a conventionally charged battery,"['battery', 'battery']"
 This means a year or so of extra longevity as in theory if the battery ages better  it should hopefully be able to hold charge better in time  an important aspect for a phone that has its battery sealed in ,"['battery', 'battery']"
  Battery Care is another proprietary Sony feature  which however is introduced with the Xperia XZ,['battery']
  Web browsing over Wi Fi depletes the Xperia XZ s battery in just over 9 hours   not spectacular  but a tangible improvement over the Z5 s 7 40h,['battery']
  In looping our test video until the battery is down to 10   the Xperia XZ lasts for 8 and a half hours  pretty much the same as the X Performance,['battery']
 Compare that to the 4 hours the Z5 barely squeezes out of its same capacity battery,['battery']
  The Wi Fi connection can be used for screen casting   be it Miracast  Google Cast  or DLNA,['screen']
 It lets you hook up USB storage and accessories and charge other devices,['storage']
 That makes sense when you have a form of screen lock enabled to protect the contents of the device,['screen']
 On its right are the proximity and ambient light sensors  and on the left you ll find the front facing camera,['camera']
  The camera in the top left corner with a flash underneath it,['camera']
    The Galaxy S7 is meanwhile smaller in every dimension  though its display is  admittedly  0,['display']
7mm but you get a bit more screen real estate there,['screen']
 The display  for one  is the same size and resolution as the last generation   not necessarily a bad thing  but the XZ also comes with 3GB of RAM   modern day flagships will crack a condescending smile seeing that in the spec sheet,"['display', 'ram']"
  No one will laugh at the rest of it  though   top of the line Snapdragon 820 chipset  23MP camera with a trio of focusing technologies and 4K video recording  one could think the Z is required for that  had it not been for the M5   high res 13MP front camera  Type C connectivity  fingerprint reader  IP68 rating  stereo speakers   name one thing missing,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The 23MP primary camera of the Sony Xperia XZ is familiar from existing Sony high end models  but in some aspect it s better than any of them,['camera']
 These particular specs of the camera have not changed since the Xperia Z5,['camera']
 The Xperia XZ uses Sony s latest camera UI,['camera']
 The Camera App tab holds some useful features and some features  which are just there for fun,['camera']
 To put it simply  the Xperia XZ s camera output is alright,['camera']
 The Xperia XZ is equipped with a 13MP selfie camera  making it the highest res front facer on a big name flagship   Sony gets it,['camera']
2 inch display is the same size and resolution  only better  the camera has every known focusing tech built in  and an extra color temperature sensor,"['display', 'camera']"
 With the S7 edge you get more screen real estate in mostly the same physical dimensions  and it s sharper too,['screen']
  The curved Samsung flagship also has much longer battery life going for it  but its primary camera has half the pixels of the XZ s,"['battery', 'camera']"
 The greatest leap is perhaps in battery life  where the Z5 fared miserably once we adopted a specific brightness level for our battery tests,"['battery', 'battery']"
 The display itself is also an improvement   visibly  and also measurably,['display']
  Time and time again  though  we can t get truly excited about a Sony camera,['camera']
 Try not to get us wrong on this one   it s not a bad camera  it s just not the best camera  and it still beats us why Sony  of all makers  can t make it the one,"['camera', 'camera']"
  Stick to fit to screen magnification and you d appreciate the good dynamic range and genuine color reproduction  particularly in natural light,['screen']
    The selfie cam has pretty much the same features as the main camera aside from minor differences  the selfie cam s manual mode has no ISO selector or manual focus slider ,['camera']
 It even reminds you to look at the camera lens when taking a photo,['camera']
  Like other Xperias  the Xperia XZ s camera lets you capture moments in the blink of an eye   from a locked phone  it takes a mere 0,['camera']
 To use that feature  you need to enable taking a photo when waking the camera with the shutter key in Settings,['camera']
  That s not all that is new about the Xperia XZ s camera,['camera']
 The idea is that you can tap on your subject and the camera will track its movement  keeping the focus locked on it,['camera']
 Taking a look around the device  the headphone jack and USB Type C port are at the top and bottom respectively  a combined SIM card and microSD card slot is on the left  and finally  on the right side is the power button  volume rocker  and Sony s signature dedicated camera shutter button,['camera']
2 inch IPS LCD display  with a Full HD resolution  resulting in a pixel density of 424 ppi,['display']
 Under the hood  the Xperia XZ packs a quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor  backed by the Adreno 530 GPU and 3 GB of RAM,"['processor', 'ram']"
 While this is the processing package that is generally seen with most current flagships  4 GB of RAM is the norm  so the reduction may be disappointing to some,['ram']
 The Xperia XZ comes with 32 GB or 64 GB of on board storage  but if you do opt for the lower storage option  you can bolster that with a microSD card by up to 256 GB,"['storage', 'storage']"
 The US version of the device is a single SIM version  but there is also a dual SIM iteration available in some other markets  where users will have to make the choice between dual SIM capabilities and expandable storage,['storage']
 The Xperia XZ comes with a 2 900 mAh battery  with is a little smaller than a lot of other flagships out there,['battery']
 The battery is good enough to comfortably allow for a full day of use  but you won t get a whole lot more beyond that,['battery']
 Sony is known for making really good camera sensors for smartphones  but they have unfortunately never managed to get the camera quite right with their own phones,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The device is sharing the same 23 MP rear camera as the smaller Xperia X Compact  and also comes with a 5 axis image stabilization  a new laser auto focus sensor  and a RGBC IR that helps get the most accurate white balance  regardless of the lighting condition,['camera']
 Where the Xperia XZ differs from its smaller sibling is when it comes to the front facing camera  with the former coming with a 13 MP shooter  instead of the 5 MP front facing unit of the Xperia X Compact,['camera']
 The front camera of the Xperia XZ allows for plenty of detail and color to be captured  and you also get a lot more flexibility with zooming into and cropping shots,['camera']
 t is very quick and easy to launch the camera and take a shot  especially when using the dedicated camera key  and the pictures it takes are surprisingly very good,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The camera does to tend overexpose shots though  and there is a lot of blooming in the highlights,['camera']
 The camera can also be really slow to capture a picture poorly lit situations  and if you aren t holding the phone perfectly steady  you will end up with a lot of blurry shots,['camera']
 This integration goes up to the point where the Google Now second screen is now a part of the Xperia launcher as well,['screen']
 The Xperia XZ has got a refreshing  new  and beautiful design which is still true to Sony  and also features a beautiful display  excellent performance  and a really great camera,"['display', 'camera']"
  There is so much to like about this phone that I was able to forgive the lack of Quad HD display and a fingerprint sensor,['display']
  The rest of the camera experience is typically what has been available from Sony,['camera']
 The camera app is fairly simplistic  and navigating between Superior Auto  Manual  Video Recording  or switching to the front facing camera can all be done by simply swiping on the screen,"['camera', 'camera', 'screen']"
 The only quirk with Sony s default camera app is that the HDR mode is still buried in the camera settings  and is only accessible when using the Manual mode,"['camera', 'camera']"
 If you are running out of battery and can t get to a charger easily  you do get Sony s staple Stamina and Ultra Stamina modes that limit performance and certain functionality in favor of longer battery life,"['battery', 'battery']"
  Two small slits above and below the display house dual stereo front facing speakers  which sound excellent  with no distortion even at the highest volume,['display']
  With a 1080p display  you ll generally get much smoother game play and graphics performance when compared to Quad HD screens  because of the reduced strain on the GPU,['display']
 Despite having 3 GB of RAM  I haven t managed to slow this phone down with heavy amounts of multi tasking either  so you certainly won t feel the loss of an additional gig of RAM,"['ram', 'ram']"
    The screen is plenty sharp for comfortably reading text and web browsing  has excellent viewing angles  and is surprisingly very vibrant,['screen']
 Brightness is of no concern  and the display is easily view able outdoors,['display']
 There are also some benefits to having a lower resolution display  particularly in terms of performance and battery life,"['display', 'battery']"
  As I also noted in the full review of the Xperia X Compact  the inclusion of a dedicated camera button provides a quick and easy way to get to the camera and is very convenient  but having all the buttons on the right makes the whole side feel quite cluttered,"['camera', 'camera']"
2 inch display  which allows for a relatively easy one handed handling experience  despite the back plate being made with metal,['display']
 Speaking of the metal backing  there are no plastic inserts to be found here  resulting in the NFC chip being moved from the back  where it is normally expected to be  to the front  next to the front facing camera,['camera']
 Out of all the Sony phones we ve reviewed that feature a 5 inch plus screen  this one feels the easiest to hold,['screen']
 The Sony Xperia XZ s Full HD screen is bright and quite large  making this a great choice if you re looking for a phone to watch a lot of movies and TV on,['screen']
 It features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset   which is one of the best on the market right now   working in tandem with 3GB of RAM,['ram']
 You may see some phones with 4GB or 6GB of RAM on board  but 3GB does the job nicely here,['ram']
 Battery life on the Xperia XZ isn t going to blow your mind  but it s going to last you through the average day   as long as any other flagship phone in 2016   and most users will be happy with that,['battery']
 By the end of the day it generally had between 10  and 30  of its charge left   one night it was bedtime before we got the 30  battery notification  although you won t have that much juice left at such a late hour if you re going to be intensively using your phone,['battery']
 This disables background data and GPS when the screen is off  as well as image enhancement and vibrations,['screen']
 We put the Xperia XZ through the TechRadar battery test   running a 90 minute clip with the screen at maximum brightness and accounts syncing over Wi Fi in the background   and it had 74  left at the end,"['battery', 'screen']"
 Sony is pushing the camera as the headline feature of the Xperia XZ   but you wouldn t be blamed for wondering what s new here when looking at the spec list,['camera']
 There s a 13MP front facing camera here  which rivals some of the more impressive Chinese handsets designed to let you indulge your narcissistic tendencies,['camera']
 You can capture Full HD video on the front facing camera too  meaning that video calls will look as good as you ll ever need them to,['camera']
 It doesn t have the high end screen spec you d get on the Samsung Galaxy S7,['screen']
  If you re considering the Sony Xperia XZ  here are the other phones you might want to consider  both from Sony and rival brands   The real highlights of the Xperia XZ come in the form of the new and improved design   with waterproofing  yet again   as well as little tweaks to the camera,['camera']
  With a top of the range speedy processor  3GB of RAM and improved software the Xperia XZ will allow you to do whatever you want on your phone with ease,"['processor', 'ram']"
  It would have been nice to see a 2K display on the Xperia XZ  but Sony knows best what its batteries are capable of  and has stuck to Full HD,['display']
 While it wasn t particularly noticeable when taking photos on the phone  comparing images to ones shot on the Xperia Z5 on a computer screen revealed that color fidelity on the Xperia XZ has improved by quite some way,['screen']
  Sony s camera also features optical image stabilization  and records video in 4K,['camera']
 We found video quality to be impressive  but 4K is of limited use considering the screen on this device is only Full HD,['screen']
 The marketing for the Xperia XZ features images of dogs jumping in the air  so we tried to recreate those shots with TechRadar s Home Ents writer Jon Porter   The Xperia XZ comes with a 23MP rear camera  which is the same size sensor we ve seen before  and has a maximum aperture of f 2,['camera']
  Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge  with its 3600mAh battery  that s quite poor   the S7 Edge only dropped 14  of its battery in the same test,"['battery', 'battery']"
 And it s especially poor when you consider that the Xperia XZ only has a Full HD screen  and not a 2K display,"['screen', 'display']"
  The Xperia XZ won t stun you with its battery life  then  but it will see you through a day of moderate use  and will hopefully last longer over time than the Xperia Z5 and many other Android phones,['battery']
    If you re waiting on an important phone call you can always use the Ultra Stamina mode   this only allows access to the phone and basic apps such as contacts  messages and camera,['camera']
  Sony wants to help you optimize battery performance over the lifetime of the phone  and this will help   it s a welcome feature if you re planning on hanging on to your XZ for a few years,['battery']
  The Xperia Z5 series phones weren t the best in terms battery life  but they weren t the worst either   and it s a similar story here,['battery']
  How good is the battery on the Xperia XZ  This video will show you   We ve already touched on gaming performance  and no apps crashed during our time with the phone either   that happened fairly often with the Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Premium,['battery']
  You may find storage a bit of an issue   the Xperia XZ comes with 32GB as standard and there s no larger capacity model  and it s not too hard to fill up 32GB given that Android takes up 10GB before you add any apps  music or movies,['storage']
  The only issue here is that the screen on the Xperia XZ is a little too small for playing games on a regular basis   for that we d recommend picking up an Xperia Z4 Tablet with its 2K 10 inch screen,"['screen', 'screen']"
    The screen is bright and looks good though   it s not 2K  but that s likely not a deal breaker or a reason to not buy the Xperia XZ,['screen']
  For those situations you can just use the on screen unlock pattern or pin  so it s not a major issue,['screen']
2 inch screen on the Xperia XZ  which may feel a little large for those with smaller hands,['screen']
 This is an average size screen for flagship smartphones right now  but you should note you ll likely need to use both hands to reach all the edges,['screen']
 There are small improvements to the design  camera and battery tech   but there s no big  headline feature or major difference when you compare it to the Xperia Z5,"['camera', 'battery']"
Its credentials are the usual in all Xperia a design with straight lines and a good camera at least in theory,['camera']
There are no physical buttons on the front only the volume and off camera on the right side,['camera']
"For its part, the camera button is used to activate the corresponding app as well as to focus and shoot",['camera']
To play music is fine but has a clear disadvantage makes the body of the mobile is significantly larger than it should if we consider the size of your screen,['screen']
If during the analysis of the Sony Xperia XZ we have found a surprising feature is its screen,['screen']
The pretensions of the manufacturer are to emphasize in other aspects as the camera and the design still is the panel what really catches the attention,['camera']
The opinion that deserves the screen of the new Xperia is really good,['screen']
The two technologies responsible for the performance of the panel are the Triluminos screen and the Motor X Reality,['screen']
Perhaps more points per inch since with only 424 is a little far from the best smartphone screen the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge that has 534,['screen']
The optimization is good which has a positive impact on both the performance and battery life,['battery']
Another glue that can be put is that the screen is not activated by putting your finger on the reader an option that more manufacturers should start considering,['screen']
The performance is assured since with a Snapdragon 820 four-core GPU Adreno 530 and 3GB of RAM there is no process that will resist,['ram']
"Although there are those who may think that 3 GB of RAM are few, it really is not so",['ram']
Sony has not entered the scale of specifications that lead to other brands to plan and mobile with 8 GB of RAM,['ram']
Sony wanted to place the camera of its top of range as one of the best in the market,['camera']
That is why other manufacturers innovate in other aspects like the dual camera,['camera']
For the Xperia XZ Sony has remained in its thirteen and goes to the 23 MP in the main camera and 13 in the one of selfies with Sensor Exmor RS f 1 2 3 and wide-angle of 23mm in the case of the first,['camera']
"If you buy a mobile phone like the XZ to take photos, it is essential to have a good Micro SD or you will have trouble with the storage space",['storage']
In the second of them the camera software automatically recognizes the scene and applies the mode that suits you best while in the manual you do not,['camera']
It can become desperate what makes Xperia XZ a good camera that could give much more of itself,['camera']
The camera of a high-end mobile should require much more than a handful of megapixels,['camera']
As a counterpoint to this certainly critical opinion of the Sony Xperia XZ camera it must be said in its favor that it captures movement and colors really well and intensely and focuses with surprising speed,['camera']
For its part the front camera for selfies has 13 MP more than most of the main cameras although it repeats the same mistakes as its older sister,['camera']
The video reaches up to 4K although it does not appear in the options provided by the camera software but as a separate mode,['camera']
The camera of this smartphone also succeeds in successfully capturing the movement in a fluid way and conveying a sense of naturalness that other mobiles do not achieve,['camera']
900 mAh battery power up the autonomy of this smartphone,['battery']
With maximum brightness the battery of the Xperia XZ will give you approximately a day of autonomy more if you choose one of the battery-saving modes or if you lower the brightness to the panel,['battery']
The screen is very bright and we know that this section of the hardware is the one that consumes the most battery,"['screen', 'battery']"
To make an analysis of the battery life of the Xperia XZ we have put it to play video in HD streaming through Youtube,['battery']
Taking into account the brightness of the screen is not bad,['screen']
Comes to be the equivalent to the Battery Saving of most Android devices but in this case offers to modify how you want to be thrifty with consumption,['battery']
Almost half an hour is taken to charge the 50's of your battery and almost two and a half for a full charge much more than desirable,['battery']
Not so if you use certain applications such as the camera,['camera']
In just half an hour taking photos the battery is left up to 30 of its capacity,['battery']
Something similar happens with the NFC chip placed just to the left of the camera of selfies,['camera']
One of the slots can be used to expand its storage capacity by 256 GB in addition to the 32 or 64 internal storage,"['storage', 'storage']"
The main one is the absence of optical stabilizer in the camera of photos,['camera']
"True, it is a smartphone that serves almost everything with a good screen and a design that a large part of the public may seem attractive although it is a matter of taste",['screen']
