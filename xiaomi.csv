"El primero de los terminales de gama alta más esperados en este 2017 ya ha pasado por nuestras manos y, lo cierto, es que como es habitual en los productos de la compañía China la sensación final que queda es bastante buena, pero se ha perdido cierto encanto inicial de este fabricante en lo que se refiere a la sorpresa (por otro lado, algo normal con el paso del tiempo y debido a que los usuarios ya se han acostumbrado a su buen hacer). Nos referimos al Xiaomi Mi 6.
A continuación, vamos a indicar lo que nos ha parecido el Xiaomi Mi 6 al utilizarlo de forma habitual y poniéndole a prueba con las herramientas que habitualmente utilizamos en MovilZona. De esta forma creemos que se tendrá más o menos claro si este modelo es el que mejor relación calidad/precio presenta en el segmento más potente del mercado y, además, si merece la pena su compra.
No hay duda que en este apartado se ha evolucionado de forma interesante en la compañía China, sólo hay que ver el imponente aspecto que ofrece el Xiaomi Mi 6. Pero, lo cierto, es que este modelo que hemos analizado es ciertamente continuista, con influencias de allí y allá… por lo que no hay una gran innovación. Y, justo en esto, es donde queda algo lejos de los modelos de gama alta anunciados en el 2017, como por ejemplo el Samsung Galaxy S8, que es más llamativo a nuestro juicio.
Un par de detalles que pasados unos días nos quedaron claros es que por un lado el smartphone se escurre con una facilidad pasmosa, por lo que se debe tener cuidado ya que la fragilidad del cristal de la carcasa está ahí (se agradece, eso sí, la inclusión de una funda, que es algo sosa, pero aporta resistencia). Por otro lado, la protección oleofóbica, simplemente, no está y el resultado es el siguiente: se ensucia con mirarlo.
Ahora toca hablar del frontal del Xiaomi Mi 6, donde lo que más destaca es la pantalla. De su calidad hablaremos luego, y el aprovechamiento que ofrece es correcto, pero sin ser destacable (ocupa algo más del 71 %). No faltan los botones táctiles de control del sistema operativo, dos de ellos son un simple punto –algo que no nos gusta en exceso ya que no se identifican bien) y, como no, el propio que hace las veces de Home y que incluye el lector de huellas. Este, por cierto, sí que creemos que ha experimentado una mejora y ahora está al nivel de los mejores del mercado. Realmente es rápido y eficiente.
Sin lugar a dudas, es en el hardware donde destaca este modelo. Tanto, que sin temor a equivocarnos decir que está entre los cinco más potentes del mercado actual tiene todo el sentido y la lógica del mundo. Aquí es donde habitualmente el fabricante chino ha destacado, y el Xiaomi Mi 6 no es una excepción. Son varias las razones que nos llevan a decir esto, pero las dos principales son una memoria de 6 GB y un procesador Snapdragon 835 (con su correspondiente Adreno 540). Ahí es nada y, además, hay que decir que el coste de este modelo no es precisamente una barbaridad.
Evidentemente su rendimiento es excelente con todo tipo de aplicaciones actuales, ya sean las habituales o los juegos más exigentes que se pueden descargar de Play Store (sí, el Xiaomi Mi 6 tiene acceso a la tienda de Google). Pero esto es algo que más o menos se puede esperar en un gama alta, pero en el caso del dispositivo del que hablamos hemos comprobado que hay capacidad de sobra para todo lo que se desee hacer, y mucho más –vamos, que la experiencia de uso es espectacular, con velocidades de ejecución increíbles y que solo modelos como el Sony Xperia XZ Premium o el Samsung Galaxy S8 pueden llegar a ofrecer).
Por cierto, que la versión del sistema operativo que se utiliza en el Xiaomi Mi 6 es Android 7.1.1, con la personalización MIUI 8. De esta no vamos a hablar mucho, ya que como es habitual ofrece una buena cantidad de opciones personalizadas y que, para nuestra sorpresa en algunas ocasiones se han quedado residentes en memoria más de lo esperado. Esto nos ha dado como consecuencia algunos sobrecalentamientos puntuales, que sin duda con una actualización de optimización se podrán depurar. Exceptuando lo comentado, no es muy perjudicial para el hardware el software incluido.
La autonomía no desentona en el Xiaomi Mi 6 y, lo cierto, es que se exprimen bastante bien en condiciones normales los 3.350 mAh que tiene la batería del terminal. Hemos llegado sin problemas a un día y medio de uso, lo que no está mal teniendo en cuenta el procesador que integra (ahí se dejan notar los 10 nanómetros de tecnología de fabricación que se utilizan en el Snapdragon 835). Además, la pantalla –de la que hablaremos a continuación. – no es muy exigente, por lo que el cóctel resultante es convincente.
Con la pantalla encendida de forma constante, y dependiendo del brillo, la horquilla va desde las seis horas hasta picos de once, lo que está bastante bien. Y, como el Xiaomi Mi 6 incluye carga rápida (Quick Charge 3.0, y es una pena que sea la cuarta versión), conseguir rellenar el 50% de la batería es cuestión de sólo 30 minutos, una buena marca pero que está en línea con la inmensa mayoría de los gama alta de este 2017.
La pantalla integrada en el Xiaomi Mi 6 es de 5,15 pulgadas con un panel IPS con resolución Full HD. Es una selección sensata, ya que esto favorece a la autonomía y, como la densidad de píxeles sube hasta los 426 ppp, lo cierto es que la definición no es precisamente un problema. Pero, eso sí, de la realidad virtual, por el momento mejor no hablar ya que para ofrecer una experiencia de calidad se tendría que subir a QHD (lo que sí hacen rivales como el Galaxy S8 o el LG G6).
Sin verse mal, lo cierto es que el brillo no está del todo mal (600 nits), pero los colores no se representan igual de bien que en alguna de su competencia directa. Se nota que, aquí, Xiaomi no ha echado el resto como sí lo ha hecho en el procesador y la RAM. No es que se vea mal, ya que el rango dinámico no está mal del todo, pero no estamos ante un modelo que destaque especialmente, ¿Cumple por el precio que tiene, que se sitúa en torno a los 400 o 450 euros? Eso sí, sin duda alguna.
Estamos ante otra de las evoluciones destacadas en el Xiaomi Mi 6, ya que el dispositivo incluye dos sensores de 12 megapíxeles donde el principal, (con apertura F:1.8) ofrece estabilización óptica y, el secundario, con F2.6 le ayuda para poder conseguir un zoom 2X. Sí, como el iPhone, pero sin llegar al nivel de este. Pero, eso sí, no nos ha disgustado para nada lo que ofrece el Xiaomi Mi 6 a la hora de hacer fotos.
Ni que decir tiene que con buena luz el comportamiento es excelente, como no puede ser de otra forma al contar con un sensor principal Sony IMX386, pero con lo competido que está este apartado en la gama alta, es cuando la luminosidad no es la mejor posible cuando se puede conocer si el trabajo realizado en un smartphone en el apartado de la fotografía es bueno o no. Aquí el comportamiento es notable, pero no llega al nivel de la competencia directa en muchas ocasiones. Eso sí, la rapidez de trabajo que ofrece la cámara es destacable, así como la aplicación de control, que es completa.
No nos ha gustado mucho cómo trabaja en HDR donde difumina algo las tomas, pero su ayuda se antoja esencial en momentos donde los pasos de luz son muy notables. Un ejemplo de lo que hemos conseguido con el Xiaomi Mi 6 son las siguientes fotografías:
La grabación es bastante buena, y aquí se agradece bastante la inclusión de el estabilizador de cuatro ejes. La calidad máxima es 4K y, lo cierto, es que aquí también hemos comprobado que el enfoque es bastante rápido.
Resumiendo: el Xiaomi Mi 6 ha dado un paso importante en la calidad de la fotografía, eso es evidente, pero no le da para alcanzar lo que ofrecen algunos modelos que están mejor preparados y que son de los mejores, como puedes ser el Xperia XZ Premium o el propio LG G6 (sin olvidar al Galaxy S8). El caso, es que, si se sigue por este camino, poco a poco se recortarán las distancias pero, siempre, hay que tener presente lo que cuesta este smartphone.
Por lo que cuesta y lo que ofrece, el Xiaomi Mi 6 nos parece una buena opción en lo que tiene que ver con la relación calidad/precio. Posiblemente es el mejor en este apartado en la actualidad, a la espera de probar el OnePlus 5. Eso sí, en algunos apartados como el diseño o la pantalla, está claramente un escalón por debajo de los más destacados que hemos probado hasta la fecha.
Su hardware es potentísimo y su autonomía más que solvente. Da un paso en lo que tiene que ver con la fotografía, pero todavía tiene que mejorar, especialmente en los momentos donde la luz no es la mejor posible. ¿Es recomendable? Lo cierto es que sí, ya que se puede estar más que seguro que todo tipo de trabajos, el que sea, se ejecuta con una solvencia pasmosa. Lo siguiente que tendría que hacer el fabricante es darle un toque diferencial como por ejemplo dotándolo de algunas opciones del Mi Mix, lo que aumentaría su atractivo -aparte, también sería de agradecer que fuera resistente al agua y polvo, no sólo a las salpicaduras-.
Los marcos laterales están bien de dimensiones, sin llegar a los niveles del Mi Mix (que son de otra galaxia) y, eso sí, de compatibilidad con HDR nada de nada. Es decir, que se cumple con el expediente, pero sin destacar en exceso e, incluso, algún gama media premium es capaz de ofrecer, como poco, el mismo nivel en su pantalla que el ofrecido por el Xiaomi Mi 6.
Como es habitual en los terminales de Xiaomi, no es posible ampliar el almacenamiento incluido, que en la unidad que hemos probado es de 64 GB y que, sin ser especialmente rápido (los hemos visto mejores ya que este componente es tipo UFS 2.0, la verdad), cumple perfectamente para que no se produzca cuello de botella alguno al trabajar con el procesador y la RAM. Por cierto, un par de detalles a conocer: este Xiaomi Mi 6 incluye NFC y Bluetooth 5.0, lo que es un excelente detalle ahora que el puerto de auriculares ha desparecido del teléfono. Por cierto, que la cobertura WiFi nos ha parecido fantástica por cierto, que el terminal tiene emisor de infrarrojos-.
Estos son algunos de los resultados que hemos obtenido en las pruebas de rendimiento y que demuestran que la combinación de RAM y el procesador de Qualcomm permiten ser al Xiaomi Mi 6 de lo mejor que hemos visto hasta la fecha (veremos que ocurre cuando el OnePlus 5 pase por nuestras manos):
Resumiendo, el Xiaomi Mi 6 es un teléfono bonito que no desentona y que cumple perfectamente, pero que no destaca frente a modelos con los que supuestamente se enfrenta, como pueden ser los de Samsung y LG (ambos, en nuestra opinión nos resultan más atractivos y diferenciales). Al no sorprender y ser continuista, quizá algunos puedan sentir que no les llama la atención, es lógico, pero lo bueno de este teléfono, realmente, está por dentro como vamos a indicar.
En la distribución de los elementos externos, no hay grandes novedades ya que en los laterales están los botones, de buen recorrido y que encajan perfectamente con el diseño, y en la parte trasera está la carcasa con sus dos sensores (ya hablaremos de ella) sin que estos sobresalgan de la misma. Buen trabajo de integración. En la parte superior apenas se hay nada que rompa con las líneas curvadas, mientras que la inferior está todo lo referente al sonido, que es sorprendentemente potente todo hay que decirlo, y el puerto USB tipo C, como no puede ser de otra forma.
Estéticamente el Xiaomi Mi 6 es atractivo, de eso no hay duda, con una acabado en metal y cristal que mantiene lo que muchos modelos ofrecen (algunos de los ya pertenecientes a la gama media, como puede ser el Galaxy A5 2017, que ya hemos probado). El caso, es que con unas líneas algo más curvadas que el modelo al que sustituye, el smartphone que hemos analizado no desentona ni en el peso (168 gramos) ni en el grosor, que está por debajo de los ocho milímetros. Bonito, sí, pero nada de efecto “wow”, ni por asomo.
Lo cierto es que da la sensación de que habría que hacer una gama de producto exclusiva para los fabricantes que llegan de este país asiático, y que compiten con los mejores del mercado, cada uno con sus particularidades claro. Ya que cada vez están mucho más definidos. Pero, el caso, es que sea más o menos sorprendente el Xiaomi Mi 6, la verdad es que si hay algo que nos ha quedado claro al probarlo es que estamos ante un modelo potente, sin que por ello sea perfecto en todos los apartados que lo componen (como, por otro lado, es lógico pensar).

"Seven years in the making. That's what Xiaomi says and you can feel the pride of a job well done. Is it arrogance? Maybe. And it may be surprising but not completely unfounded. A five-inch screen in a hot, curved metal-and-glass body. A dual camera with 2x optical zoom. A Snapdragon 835. The Xiaomi Mi 6 has many virtues and well... modesty isn't one of them.
Now, being a mix of every new trending feature around the Xiaomi Mi 6 is surely going to step on a lot of flagship toes. And it sure looks like an offer you can't refuse. Even the premium model is half the price of a name brand counterpart - we're talking ceramic finish and 18-karat gold-plated camera rims.
The Mi 6 lost the audio jack in favor of more battery juice, which should have made it easier for Xiaomi to focus on waterproofing. Recent teardowns have revealed that Xiaomi attempted to secure the Mi 6 against water, yet the USB port omits any kind of seals and is left completely unprotected. The company just did not go the extra mile, for some reason. IP68 certification could have made up for the lack of the fan-favorite audio jack.
So, the Mi 6. The low-cost flagship redefined. Xiaomi's most powerful smartphone and an ambitious cameraphone. It looks like an exciting journey ahead. Follow us on the next page where we look closely at one of the best-looking phones lately. Well, perhaps a little too familiar-looking if you know what we mean.
The Mi 6 ships in a regular cardboard box, which contains a Quick Charge 3.0-enabled charger plug and a USB Type-C cable. The company has also thrown in a silicone case and a USB-to-3.5mm analog adapter as an extra for the Mi 6. You will need the latter, as there are no bundled headphones.
The Mi 6 measures 145.2 x 70.5 x 7.5mm, roughly the same as the Mi 5. The Mi 6 has notably gained some weight, though. The regular Mi 6 is now 168g, that's 39g more than the Mi 5. The ceramic model is even heavier at 182g; some 43g up from the Mi 5's ceramic edition.
The Xiaomi Mi 5 won a lot of hearts last year with its stylish and lightweight glass sandwich design. In spite of the fragile build, the Mi 5 kept appearing on our recommendation lists - not only because of its feature set but for its looks as well. This year, Xiaomi righted all of the wrongs and the Mi 6 continues to wow us with style and build quality.
The Mi 6 gained almost 40g, and most of those we can attribute to the sturdy stainless-steel frame and the larger battery. Unlike the Mi 5, the Mi 6 won't break under pressure and is shaping up to be one of the better-built glass phones this year.
The highlight of the refreshed glass sandwich design is the rear piece of Gorilla 5, which Xiaomi likes to call four-sided curved 3D. Indeed, the curve flows seamlessly around the edge and continues naturally on the corners instead of ending abruptly into the frame. While this is a rather subtle improvement, we understand the engineering challenge, and it was all worth it for those extra style points.
A Gorilla 5 glass piece also covers the front of the Mi 6, but of a rather common origin - a regular flat piece with a rounded 2.5D edge along the ends. The placeholder for the capacitive Home key is almost like carved out of the front screen glass and it does not come with a metal rim as was the case on the Mi 5.
Thanks to its mid-sized footprint, the Mi 6 fits nicely in hand and can be easily operated without stretching your fingers. The phone is slippery but not much as you'd expect from an all glossy design. It's like Xiaomi has applied some oleophobic coating. The glass and frame are somewhat grippy, but also very easy to clean- even with a bare hand.
Unless you are looking for the analog audio jack, the Mi 6 is business as usual. Above the screen is the earpiece, which also doubles as a speaker. The 8MP selfie camera is around, a notification LED, and a couple of sensors.
Much have changed since the Mi 5, but the display is not among the long list of upgrades. The Xiaomi Mi 6 uses a 5.15"" IPS LCD with 1080p resolution. We're already used to seeing QHD screens on flagships but on a screen of this diagonal, we're quite content with 1080p as well.
The pixel density of 428ppi is great and provides a very sharp image. Xiaomi promises 600nits of maximum brightness and 1500:1 contrast. Putting those claims to test, we can confirm we got exactly 603nits or maximum brightness. Unfortunately, the contrast ratio was not as good as advertised. Due to the not-so-deep blacks it only managed to achieve 1305:1, which is quite good too.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 managed to surprise in our sunlight legibility test scoring as high as an AMOLED panel would.
You can choose from three different options for the screen's color calibration. The default one is Automatic, which also optimizes the contrast dynamically in response to the available ambient light. When you use the phone in bright light, it would brighten up any dark on-screen areas to make them better legible.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 has a sealed battery of 3,350mAh. That's a 10% improvement over the Mi 5. The phone supports Quick Charge 3.0 and the supplied charger can fill up to 55% of a depleted battery in 30 minutes.
Our endurance rating stands for how long a single battery charge will last you if you were to use the Xiaomi Mi 6 for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily. We've established this usage pattern so our battery results are comparable across devices in the most common day-to-day tasks. The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 is well-stocked with connectivity options, mostly due to the well-equipped Snapdragon 835 SoC. The Mi 6 offers LTE at Cat. 16 with impressive 1Gbps of download, courtesy of the latest Qualcomm modem with 3x carrier aggregation.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 comes with Android 7.1.1 Nougat and MIUI 8.2. MIUI is one of the most extensive customizations of Android to date. It has a big following in China where Google services are not accessible so Xiaomi refocused the ecosystem away from Mountain View's services. For those living elsewhere, the official and not-so-official importers are providing various international (global) ROMs, which come stripped from the Chinese services, in favor of Google's.
MIUI 8 is a familiar launcher already with lots of new features and UI tweaks. Its looks are just a minor part of the way MIUI is different from stock Android, though.
The highlights of the MIUI 8 features are Dual Apps and dual spaces. Dual Apps means you can have two instances of the same app on your device. This allows you to do things like have two WhatsApp accounts on the same phone, one for each SIM.
Dual spaces lets you have two different workspaces on your device, each with its own set of apps, customizations, and image gallery, and you can enter a custom passcode or a different fingerprint to enter either space.
Xiaomi Mi 6 utilizes the latest Snapdragon 835 chip by Qualcomm. It packs an octa-core Kryo 280 processor (4x2.46GHz and 4x1.9GHz), Adreno 540 GPU, and 6 gigs of RAM in the case of Mi 6.
GeekBench 4 is always a good start for our benchmarking routine. Apple is still king in the single-core processing, but the new Kryo 280 core is the best performer among the Android crowd right now.
But Apple has to step down when all four high-speed Kryo 280 cores work together. The Snapdragon 835 has one of the most powerful processor to date, sharing the first place with Samsung's Exynos 8895 Octa.
As far as graphics are concerned, our recent tests often showed the Adreno 540 as one of the best GPU on the mobile scene right now. GFX's offscreen tests confirm that, putting the GPU inside the Mi 6 on top of the charts.
Having the advantage of the lower 1080p resolution, the Mi 6 GPU does even more impressive on the onscreen benchmarks. It is bested only by the iPhone 7, which runs on even lower 750p screen.
Basemark's X and ES3.1 tests show us a different perspective. Both apps feature on- and off-screen tests, and thus give a better understanding of the GPU performance. The Mi 6's Adreno 540 is slightly behind the Mali-G71 MP20 GPU inside the Galaxy S8 series, but still an admirable performer.
Finally, we ran BaseMark OS II compound benchmarks - they gauge CPU, GPU, RAM, Web, and OS performance. Here, the Xiaomi Mi 6 aced every single stress test and thus occupies the top spot in the charts. The Snapdragon 835 chip may not be an equal to the latest Exynos SoC, but having a 1080p screen helped the Mi 6 score better than the Galaxy S8 lineup.
For what the Xiaomi Mi 6 lacks in pixel count, it makes up in performance. There is nothing that Mi 6 can't handle right now and it should be performance-proof for at least a few years post any 1440p smartphone lifecycle. Even better, there is not a single app or game to lag on the Mi 6 for whatever reason, something we can't say for the Galaxy S8 of the LG G6.
The dialer and the phonebook share a single app, but two shortcuts bring you straight to the tab you need. The app has a pleasant flat look which feels somewhat fresh. It uses a tabbed interface - recents and dialer on the first and the contact list on the second.
The dialer may look rather familiar, but it's quite capable. Unfortunately, most of the new smart features are only available in the few markets where Xiaomi has an official presence.
The stereo speakers on the Xiaomi Mi 6 scored a 'Very Good' mark in our speaker loudness test, up from the Good mark achieved by the Mi 5 and consistent with what we measured for the Mi 5s. The sound is rich and crisp, with good bass and clean high notes.
The MIUI v8 also offers a Security app. It can scan your phone for malware, manage your blacklist, manage or restrict your data usage, configure battery behavior, and free up some RAM. It can also manage the permissions of your installed apps.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 comes with a custom Gallery app that shows the camera row by default, but the second tab includes all images and videos on the phone. You can set up a photo backup with your Mi Cloud account.
The MIUI music player is a custom app with a well laid out, easy to navigate interface. The player has cool effects, transitions, and transparent elements, especially on the expandable Now Playing section. Lyrics are supported, too.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 did splendidly in the first part of our audio test. When hooked to an active external amplifier it delivered very loud and yet perfectly accurate output.
Now, the Mi 6 is hopping on the dual-camera train, but it has swapped the monochrome sensor with a telephoto one. Huawei's idea has been replaced with Apple's, if you will.
The Xiaomi Mi 6, just like the Mi 5, snaps pictures blazingly fast, resolves a great deal of detail, and the noise levels are kept reasonably low. The white balance is accurate, and we liked the lively color rendition. The dynamic range is high without ever resorting to HDR. There is no corner softness either. And finally, we have to note the amazing foliage presentation.
The telephoto camera also does a great job in good light and comes in handy when you need a bit of zoom. Its quality gets close to the main camera's - the images have plenty of detail and the same great processing, colors, and dynamic range. Now, the images often come out a bit softer and are usually shot at a faster shutter speed than the regular ones and hence - at a higher ISO.
The Mi 6 regular camera has a wide dynamic range, sure, but there are times when you'd still want to use the HDR. Here the phone does a great job brightening up the shadows though some of the highlights may be compromised in the process.
The dusk shots turned out fine, with little noise and accurate colors. The stabilization and the wider aperture help the Mi 6's main camera to produce pleasant pictures with lots of fine detail and natural colors despite the spike in the noise levels.
The Mi 6 is capable of further slowing down the shutter speed to as low as 1/4s but that's in Manual mode. It's not much as we've seen other phones offer much longer exposure times, but we guess you can download a long-exposure camera app from the Play Store if it's badly needed.
Just like Apple, Xiaomi wants you to use the telephoto camera only in really good light and mostly for portraits. Due to the lens' narrower aperture of f/2.6, the lack of optical stabilization and its smaller sensor, the telephoto camera is probably unfit to capture good low light images.
Portrait mode uses the Telephoto camera and some software trickery to create a photo with a faux bokeh - an artificially blurry background resembling the one that occurs naturally when you use a lens with a bright aperture on a large sensor camera. It's quite the same as the Portrait Mode that Apple brought to the iPhone 7 Plus, and even the helper text in the viewfinder is identical to Apple's. While HTC was probably the first to introduce this effect with the One M8 way ahead of its time, Huawei was actually the first to make it trendy (and naturally looking) with the P9.
We also snapped the same scenes with the iPhone 7 Plus. Its images came out with somewhat duller colors and less contrast (that's how the camera is tuned in this generation), but the pixel-peepers will find the bokeh effect to be better. We also noticed that the iPhone's real-time blur that you see in the viewfinder before you take the picture is more accurate than the messy preview Xiaomi is offering.
You can capture only portrait panoramic photos with an 180-degree field of view. Shooting is easy and the resolution high at 64MP (up 4,000px tall). The image quality is great - there is plenty of fine detail, accurate colors, and no signs of bad stitching. The dynamic range is great as is the contrast. The pano shots are somewhat softer than the regular shots, and the foliage isn't as great, but given the high resolution we are happy with what we got.
We also tested out the 8MP front-facing camera. The images came out with more than enough detail, high contrast, and pleasant colors. The dynamic range is above average, too.
Video mode gives you a choice of 2160p@30fps and 1080p@30fps for common shooting with a 720p@120fps option if you want some slow-motion effects. There's no 1080p@60fps mode, though, which would make a big difference in fast-paced scenes. No telephoto videos either.
The 1080p videos are shot at a bitrate of 20Mbps and have the same audio bitrate. The video quality in 1080p is quite different to the 4K videos and we really appreciate it. The level of detail is subjectively higher and they are sharper overall.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 offers 4-axis optical image stabilization and it's advertised as being exceptionally good even compared to other OIS systems. .
Xiaomi tried to put everything that's hot right now in a low-fare package and the resulting Mi 6 is an amazing phone for the price. Xiaomi's keen on making a statement with it and challenging the big names in the game. The way the Chinese go about it is probably not the most subtle but in terms of looks and specs, the Xiaomi Mi 6 is the best Mi yet.
Clearly building on an all-glass design that originated with the Mi 5, the Xiaomi Mi 6 is not just sturdy now, it's splash-resistant too. The new dual-camera is the highlight of the package. Even if it doesn't get Mi 5 owners craving for an upgrade though, the latest Snapdragon 835 chip and 6GB of RAM might as well.
It's not just design cues that Xiaomi obviously took from Apple - the dual camera and stereo speakers are a direct response to the iPhone 7 Plus. Overall, the Mi 6's defining features are a catalog of what the current flagships have, Android or iOS.
Has Xiaomi sort of traded its own identity for a pass to the elite club? Xiaomi's isn't exactly subtle either in how the Mi 6 is being pitched. They call it the first 5.15"" smartphone with a dual camera and you can take this the wrong way if you're not paying attention. There is obviously a really strong emphasis on the screen size in this statement.
Can't blame Xiaomi for some cheeky marketing - some rules have to be bent if you're to offer this sort of package at this sort of price. So, iPhone, Huawei, and LG - they would laugh at the First Dual Camera statement but Xiaomi clearly wants to have the last laugh by offering those goodies at a fraction of the price.
Apple's iPhone 7 Plus was the first to introduce the exact dual-camera setup Mi 6 is trying to emulate - and actually succeeding. But with a price that's one-third of what Apple is asking and Android-based MIUI we feel nobody will ever have to choose between those two. The Mi 6 has been built to win this round right away - with the right group of customers, that is.
The Mi 6 succeeds where others would have likely failed, and not just on paper. It has processing power to spare, one of the best designs, a very credible camera, solid battery life, quality stereo sound. Sure, the display resolution could have been higher, but that would've hurt performance. The 5.15"" screen is reasonably sharp as it is and the 1080p resolution helps squeeze every drop of power out of the Snapdragon 835.
We shot a short 4K video while walking, and... the result wasn't peachy. The Mi 6 did fine with stabilizing the video, but what we were missing is the really smooth Steadicam-like footage, which we get from other flagship camera phones, which combine OIS with some extra digital stabilization.
Anyway, the 2160p videos are captured at a bitrate of 42Mbps and have rock solid 30fps. The audio is stereo captured at 96KBps bitrate.
The video quality is average - the resolved detail is enough and barely competitive. The dynamic range is average and they are just too soft. On the positive side, the framerate is smooth and steady, and so is the footage itself thanks to the OIS.
The audio quality is OK- there are no traces of compression, but you'll notice that the quality gets worse with loud sound sources (loud music, crowds, cars honking, etc.).
Anyway, the Mi 6 uses the combination of the two cameras to map the distance to all objects of the scene and attempts to isolate the subject in front by blurring the background. This works best when you're shooting a well-lit subject which stands out against the backdrop. The software will get fooled by a strong backlight or a busy scene.
The Mi 6 shoots its portrait shots faster than the iPhone 7+, but it takes longer for the camera to read the scene and determine where the depth effect should be. The samples turned out very pleasant with mostly accurate shapes and blur effects. It's possible for the algorithm to smear an ear or some hair, though that's not a Mi 6-specific issue, but an issue of the methods itself.
When the light is low and you try to use the 2X camera mode, the Mi 6 will resort to using a digitally zoomed photo from its main camera. This may not sound terrific, but this photo will be actually better than the one you would get from the tele cam itself. The iPhone 7 Plus resots to the same tactics when you attempt to take a zoomed picture in low light.
The telephoto lens lacks any kind of stabilization, but you would hardly need it either as when the light gets low, the phone will stop using it and would instead switch to cropping the output of the main camera to achieve the zoomed effect. The iPhone 7 Plus does the same thing, by the way. This, of course, takes its toll on image quality so we'd recommend against using the second camera in low light.
Overall, the Mi 6 has a flagship worthy camera and processing, and even at 100% magnification nothing got in the way of our positive impressions.
The regular wide-angle camera on the Mi 6 has a 12MP Sony IMX386 sensor with 27mm f/1.8 lens and 1.25µm big pixels. The 4-axis OIS we saw on the Mi 5 has made its way back into the game and is backing the IMX386.
The 12MP telephoto sensor's maker is yet to be revealed, but its specs sound familiar - 1.00µm pixels and 56mm f/2.6 lens, close to what Apple used for the iPhone 7 Plus telephoto cam - 12MP, f/2.8. There is no OIS for this camera.
The camera interface is fairly simple and features toggles for HDR, Portrait Mode, and flash on the left, and 2x telephoto and the video camera on the right.
There are 12 filters available with live previews. The camera also offers quite a few different shooting modes - Panorama, Timer, Audio, Straighten, Manual, Beautify, Group Shot, Tilt Shift, and Night (HHT) as well as the camera settings. The Manual mode lets you tweak ISO (100-3200), exposure time (up to 1/4s), white balance, and focus.
Xiaomi has been playing with different camera sensors, features, and even setups for a while now. The Mi 5 offered a great 4-axis optical stabilization on a 16MP sensor, the Mi 5s dropped the stabilization for bigger sensor pixels spread at 12MP, then the Mi 5s Plus introduced a new setup with two 13MP cameras - one shooting in color and the other in monochrome.
Plugging in a pair of headphones damaged the stereo quality but not too much and introduced a tiny bit of intermodulation distortion (that's basically only detectable with dedicated equipment such as ours). The output remained excellent and the volume was still very high so a great performance overall.
The Security app also allows you to define the battery behavior of selected apps and applies restrictions only to the apps you choose.
It can automatically recognize business numbers, as well as scan contacts thanks to the Xiaomi's Caller ID database.
Call recording is available - the files can be saved either on your device or on your MiCloud.
But does it run cool? Yes, it does. During the week we spent with the Mi 6, it has never reached anything beyond a warm state no matter for how long we ran benchmarks or played Angry Birds Pop. Pokemon Go has the power to make it a little bit hotter when played for long, but once again - nothing to really worry about. Both Qualcomm and Xiaomi did a good job with the chip and the phone's thermal-spreading design.
Unlike most of the current flagships, the Mi 6 is sticking to 1080p resolution, which will surely give it an edge over the competition in the graphics tests.
Unfortunately, unlike other flagships, the Mi 6 has very limited LTE support of just 9 bands. While it supports the widespread band 3 and 7, it omits band 20, which may be a problem in some EU countries. So, if you consider the Mi 6 and you want to use LTE networks, just make sure it supports your local band before you buy.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 also comes equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with 2x2 MIMO antennas for speeds up to 867Mbps (if you have a compatible router). The local connectivity list goes on with Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX and Low Energy, and NFC.
The Wi-Fi connection can be used for screen casting - be it Miracast, Google Cast, or DLNA.
GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou satellite positioning systems are supported, but apparently, the Mi 6 omits Galileo support.
The Xiaomi Mi 6 has no FM radio. There is no audio jack either, but Xiaomi provides a proper USB-C-to-analog jack adapter.
The USB port is Type-C but we can't confirm whether it's 2.0 or 3.x. Still, it lets you hook up USB storage and accessories and charge other devices.
We ran our battery test and the Xiaomi Mi 6 scored an 80h rating, which surprisingly is lower than the Mi 5's rating. The culprit is the Mi 6's relatively high power draw in standby mode because otherwise, it scored better in the three individual test of calling, web browsing and video. This unusual power consumption in standby might be software-related and fixed with a future update.
The standard contrast mode doesn't have that but it offers very accurate color rendering with an average DeltaE of 3.2 and maximum deviation of 5.8 in the whites.
Finally, there is the Increased Contrast, which visually oversaturates all colors, in case that's your thing.
Additionally, there is a Reading mode similar to Apple's Night Shift. It removes the blue hues in line with recent trends as they potentially interfere with your sleep quality when you use the device just before bedtime. For extra convenience, you can configure this mode to be enabled only for selected apps.
The metal rims are reserved for the camera. If you get the Ceramic Edition, those will be made of 18-karat gold!
Xiaomi opted for an all-glossy stainless-steel frame, which complements the design regardless of the finish - glass or ceramic. It is prone to fingerprints, as is the entire phone, but as far as looks are concerned the Mi 6 is nothing short of impressive.
Anyway, let's see what the Mi 6 is made of and how good it is at what it does.
There are far too many similarities with a certain Cupertino smartphone though - the lack of an audio jack, the added water-resistance, the telephoto camera for portrait photography, and the newly introduced stereo speakers. It's not that we don't welcome those upgrades, but it looks like the new Mi is for the first time trying too hard to be cool instead of simply playing to its own strengths - of which it obviously has enough.
The 6th generation comes packed with premium features, as if Xiaomi is trying to pick a fight with every contemporary flagship. The latest Snapdragon 835 chipset may as well have been the only option - no other would've suited their best phone yet.
To be fair, Xiaomi did well to refine the series design and even added splash resistance. The dual 12MP camera with a telephoto lens and portrait photography is Xiaomi's take on what seems to be the latest fad in phones. All of these - at the expense of an audio jack. If Apple can get away with it... What did we say about modesty?

"The Xiaomi Mi 6 is one of the best Android phones around.
The lack of global availability means Xiaomi may be missing the boat in most markets that would have loved to grab a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 powered phone on the cheap. The cheapest version of the phone retails for about $365, £280 or AU$485 converted, and that model gets you 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. Step it up to the 6GB RAM version with 128GB onboard storage and you'll pay 2,899 Chinese yuan -- about $420, £330 or AU$560.
The Mi 6's glass and stainless steel frame stand out. The phone comes in the standard shades of black or white, plus a much snazzier blue-and-gold version that's visually stunning.
One of the Mi 6's key features is its dual 12-megapixel camera setup, which is a hot trend these days. While it's not the first time Xiaomi has used it on phones, it's the first time a Xiaomi phone has added portrait mode similar to the one found in the iPhone 7 Plus (Xiaomi even calls it the same thing).
But when it does work, the subject remains in focus while blurring everything else. Results are pretty compelling. Check out the picture below for an example.
Aside from Portrait Mode, the Mi 6 takes great pictures, especially in bright light. It isn't as capable as the Pixel XL($809.98 at Amazon.com) or the Samsung Galaxy S8 in low light, but then again, which phone is? The quality of its low-light shots is similar to the iPhone but more saturated, giving images a nice pop, even if they're not 100 percent realistic.
Interestingly, the Mi 6's HDR function now has its own dedicated button you'll have to manually switch on and off. It doesn't seem to turn on HDR automatically the way many other phones do.
The Mi 6 joins the list of phones with no dedicated headphone jack. Instead, you'll have to use the USB-C charging port for wired headphones, or use a set of wireless Bluetooth headphones. However, the phone does come with a USB Type-C to 3.5mm audio jack converter in the box. Honestly, I'm not as bothered by the lack of an audio jack, since I prefer using wireless headphones to cut down on loose cables anyhow. You may feel differently, of course.
Qualcomm's Snapdragon 836 processor keeps the Mi 6 buttery smooth. You won't notice any lag when switching between apps or playing 3D games such as Dynasty Warriors: Unleashed. You'll love how snappy everything is. Battery life is superb as well. It lasted 17 hours 35 minutes in our lab tests and chugged through a full day of relatively heavy use without dying on me. For reference, the Galaxy S8 lasted an average of 16 hours in our video drain tests, and the S8 Plus went 18 hours.
Selfies came out looking good, but the 8-megapixel Mi 6's front-facing camera ran into the same problems as a lot of other phones when it comes to bad lighting. You just can't get around terrible backlighting. It also comes with a beauty mode, which made my face look baby smooth (it's really not).  
Besides Portrait mode, the Mi 6 also does 2x lossless zoom -- again like the iPhone. Xiaomi's features here are good, but the Mi 6 does lean on the iPhone for a lot of its inspiration, a critique I had of its past phones, too.
Portrait Mode works the same way as it does on the iPhone 7 Plus: you stand in front of the object and let the phone apply the effect. It's much simpler than the effect on previous Xioami models such as the Redmi Pro, which let you tweak the depth of field after shooting the picture. As for the quality, well, that's trickier. The Mi 6's Portrait Mode feels very finicky; half the time it detects the object properly, the other time you're either too close to apply the effect or the picture winds up being too out of focus.
I particularly loved that color, and it's a great conversation starter as well. I can't tell you how many people looked at it and said, ""Wow."" That said, the glass rear can be a tad slippery to hold at times.
The Mi 6 has a 5.15-inch screen with a 1080-pixel display that looks good to the naked eye. Pixel density isn't as sharp on paper as the Galaxy S8, but my eyes didn't strain trying to read news stories or social media updates. Colors pop, and while it has a maximum brightness of 600 nits, it goes all the way down to one at night, helping you not strain your eye. The phone won't take a long dunking like the Galaxy S8 or LG G6, but it is splash-proof, so you shouldn't worry too much about small spills.
Like other Xiaomi phones, the Mi 6 runs MIUI, a customized version of Android 7.1.1.
A premium ceramic version with 18K gold finish and 128GB of storage space sells for just a little more at 2,999 Chinese yuan. That's about $435, £340 or AU$580.
If you're lucky enough to get and use the Mi 6, you'll find an affordable flagship that matches the Galaxy S8 where it counts. Though it's missing some features, including wireless charging. It makes you wonder just how much of a premium you're paying for other high-end flagships such as the Galaxy S8 or the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. If you live outside China, keep reading to see what the Mi 6 will bring you -- but hold out for the international version before committing.
I love the Mi 6 for what it is -- an amazing device with the same speedy processor as the Samsung Galaxy S8($769.00 at Amazon.com) and a beautiful design that stands out on its own. It also comes with dual-cameras, and takes portrait pictures like the Apple iPhone 7 Plus($779.99 at Amazon Marketplace) and now, the OnePlus 5. You get Android goodness with some Apple-like features. And it costs a lot less than your typical flagship phone. What's not to like?
Well, how about the fact that it's still only available in China two months on from its launch. Xiaomi said it would reach other countries ""soon"", but it couldn't tell me when exactly it's going to start rolling out.
While eager beavers could order a Mi 6 from China, take heed that the LTE may not work in countries such as the US -- you'll have to compare to your carrier's network bands to be sure. And there are no Google Play services in China so until the company releases a global ROM, you'd have to sideload it if you want native apps such as Google Maps.

"Wow. That’s what comes to mind when you consider Xiaomi’s new flagship Android phone for 2017. The Mi6 is around half the price of more familiar flagships such as the Galaxy S8, LG G6, Sony Xperia XZ Premium and HTC U11, but it’s just as fast, just as beautiful, and just as much a must-have for anyone serious about their smartphone tech. Also see: Best Chinese phones 2017
The one drawback of the Xiaomi Mi6 is that, unlike those aforementioned rivals, it’s not available to buy directly from Xiaomi in the UK, nor from any of our major mobile operators. That means you’ll have to import it from China, and pay for the whole thing up front (though you can save some money with a SIM-only deal).
We’ve reviewed many a Xiaomi phone sent to us by GearBest, and we’ve never experienced any issues. But we acknowledge that for some customers things can sometimes go wrong, and when they do you need to remember your rights are different when purchasing goods from outside the UK. We’ve outlined some of the things you need to consider in our Chinese tech buying advice.
It’s very rare (although not unknown - remember the LG G5 and the Google Pixel XL) for a company’s flagship to look anything short of amazing. And so it is with the mirror-finish Xiaomi Mi6, though this phone appeals for more than its basic good looks.
We still have yet to see a Quad-HD Xiaomi phone - this Mi6 has a full-HD panel with a 1920x1080 pixel resolution and a density of 428ppi - but Xiaomi is not alone. It’s funny that the company it is most often accused of copying, and one that is perhaps the biggest and best-known in the western world, also has no Quad-HD smartphone in its line-up. (Hint: Xiaomi is also known as China’s Apple.)
The Mi6’s design isn’t a huge departure from the Xiaomi Mi5s before it, which means you still get the under-glass fingerprint scanner on the home screen that sort of looks like the button fell off (we’re not overly keen on it), but it has returned to the glass rear of the Mi5 that was upgraded to aluminium for the 5s. You still get a tough steel frame, and to be honest we much prefer the Galaxy-esque glass look even if it may be more vulnerable to accidental damage and oh so many fingerprints.
Well, what can we say about the Mi6’s performance: it’s breathtaking. Also see: What's the fastest phone?
We touched on the fact that this Xiaomi phone does not support 800MHz (Band 20) 4G LTE in the UK, but that 2100MHz and 2600MHz 4G are covered, and that those customers affected will still be able to receive 3G. However, something we left out was that the Mi6 actually accepts two SIMs, operating in a dual-SIM dual-standby fashion.
Something that is missing, though, is the headphone jack, which has been swapped out for a USB-C port in order to allow space for a higher-capacity battery. This may be a deciding factor for you if you’re keen on audio.
The Xiaomi Mi5s was fitted with the Sony IMX378, a 12Mp camera also used by the Google Pixel and one that offers very good image quality. It’s improved things further for the Xiaomi Mi6, now fitted with two 12Mp cameras - one with a wide-angle f/1.8 lens and the other a f/2.6 telephoto lens.
The front camera has also been upgraded from 4- to 8Mp, which is plenty clear enough for video chat and selfies.
The Xiaomi Mi6 runs MIUI 8.2, which is a custom version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow (the latest version of Android is Nougat, and Android O is expected within the next few months). The main differences you’ll notice are the lack of an app tray - everything is laid out on the home screen in an iPhone-esque fashion - and you’ll find some changes in the Settings menu. Fortunately there’s a search option at the top that makes it easier to find what you’re looking for. Also see: Best phones 2017 
MIUI 8 has some cool features of its own, including Dual apps, which in essence lets you run two instances of one app (this might come in handy if you make use of the dual-SIM functionality, for example), and in a similar vein you can also et up a second space on the phone - it’s almost like having two phones. There’s a Child mode, too.
This really is an amazing phone, and only the Chinese software puts us off recommending it for a UK audience. It is crazy fast, crazy beautiful and crazy priced. If you know your way around Android go and get one, and you won’t be disappointed.You can individually lock any app on the phone, should you rather not lock the phone itself or you want a second layer of security, and you can tweak various things such as the theme and which side of the home button your back and multi-tasking options sit. You can make use of a Quick ball, which places onscreen a shortcut to options such as screenshot and lock, although in common with the one-handed mode (which shrinks the size of the screen to a more manageable area) it is more useful for the larger models in Xiaomi’s line-up - such as the recently announced Mi Max 2.
We like MIUI 8, but we also like Android as it was intended, and that’s not something we’re ready to give up just yet.
Oh and, of course, the lack of Google Play. Which is a real issue for UK users (if you intend to use the Mi6 only for calls and texts you don’t need a Mi6). Until a Global model is offered with Google Play preinstalled we wouldn’t recommend the Mi6 to UK users who don’t know what they’re doing. Although we managed to get Google Play and various apps installed as we have outlined earlier in this review, we did still run into the odd issue, including a Gmail error message that said it was having trouble with Google Play Services.
You can, of course, use Xiaomi’s own apps for such things as email - you don’t have to use Google services at all. But if you’re already using them on your current phone, it makes no sense to switch now.
Key specs include a 10x digital zoom, 2x optical zoom, four-axis OIS and PDAF. It can also shoot 4K video, offers various shooting modes including manual, beautify, Tilt-shift and group shot, plus real-time filters. After the photo is taken there are also some decent editing tools.
We were impressed with the quality of our test images, which were very well exposed and offered very realistic colours. Detail was softer than we were expecting, however. You can view a couple of our test shots in Auto and HDR mode below, though we will be updating this review in the coming weeks once we have had a chance to compare the camera properly with other current flagships.
The fingerprint scanner is exactly the same setup as we saw in the Xiaomi Mi5s, which is to say very good - although we’re not personally keen on the way the front of the device looks. The recessed area in which you place your finger just looks odd, and we yearn for the physical response pressing an actual button would offer. But it is the future, increasingly so, and it actually works incredibly well - fast and accurate.
If you need to balance work and play and don’t want to carry around two phones, or if you’re going abroad and want to use a local SIM for data, this is a useful - and very popular outside the UK - setup. The Mi6 accepts two Nano-SIMs. In common with other Xiaomi phones one of these SIM slots can alternatively be used to add a microSD card up to 128GB in capacity, though with internal storage options of 64- and 128GB you may find you don’t need one. Also see: How to add storage to Android
The Xiaomi supports Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, GLONASS, NFC, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and even an IR blaster, which are becoming increasingly rare but people still like them for their ability to turn your phone into a remote control. Bizarrely, this was taken off the Xiaomi Mi5s, making it even more apparent that this is an update to the Xiaomi Mi5 rather than the Mi5s.
The Xiaomi features this year’s class-leading processor - the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 - but while its rivals pair this chip with 4GB of DDR4 RAM Xiaomi specifies 6GB. It’s likely to get some competition soon from the upcoming OnePlus 5, which is also rumoured to feature this setup, but for now this powerhouse is unmatched in the smartphone world.
And that is proven by its extraordinary performance in our benchmarks, as we will reveal below.
The Snapdragon 835 is a 10nm chip built in partnership between Samsung and Qualcomm, which meant no phone manufacturer was allowed to use it until the Galaxy S8 had been unveiled. Thus the LG G6, which would normally be a rival for the latest Xiaomi, was forced to use last year’s Snapdragon 821 (as seen in the 5s). Its benchmarking performance is therefore much lower.
Samsung doesn’t actually use the Snapdragon 835 in the UK - here you get the Exynos 8895 - but the Xiaomi still beat its performance in our benchmarks.
The Snapdragon 835 is a 10nm chip, which improves on Qualcomm’s previous 14nm chips with increases of up to 30 percent in efficiency, 27 percent in performance and 40 percent in power consumption. It runs at a clock speed of up to 2.45GHz with a big.LITTLE architecture, which means four of the eight cores run at a lower 1.8GHz for efficiency. 
We ran the Mi6 through our usual benchmarks and found some outstanding results. In Geekbench 4 it recorded 6472 points multi-core (1940 single-core), and it notched up a huge 170,709 points in AnTuTu.
In graphics benchmark GFXBench the Xiaomi proved itself absolutely capable of all kinds of gaming and media playback, with a very high 59fps in T-Rex, 52fps in Manhattan, 39fps in Manhattan 3.1 and 25fps in Car Chase. It’s worth pointing out that we run the onscreen tests since they are more closely related to real-world usage, though other phone reviewers often quote the offscreen results that are typically higher.
We also ran the JetStream JavaScript test, and the Mi6’s 70.0 result is as good as it gets in the Android world. Only iPhones have scored higher in our tests.
Our photo black review sample looks very much like a smaller version of the Mi Note 2, but with the camera - sorry, cameras - found flush to the frame in the top left corner. This is not the first Xiaomi to feature a dual-camera (the Redmi Pro also had one), but it is the first dual-camera Xiaomi flagship. We’ll talk more about its photography credentials later in this review.
The Mi6 is said to be splashproof, which is something we’ve not seen before from Xiaomi. As such it features a sealed SIM tray and lined ports. You’ll find USB-C on the bottom, as before, and the volume rocker in line with the SIM tray on the opposite side of the device. This sits just above the power button, while there’s an IR blaster (which is becoming increasingly rare) at the top.
But something is missing here: the 3.5mm headphone jack. Xiaomi is the latest phone maker to drop the headphone jack in favour of USB-C audio. Apple did the same thing with its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus last September, which caused a lot of complaints from users, although in the end everyone just got on with it. That’s probably because Apple supplied a headphone adaptor in the box, which is what Xiaomi has also done here.
Alternatively, you can buy yourself a pair of wireless or USB-C headphones, or rely on the phone’s built-in audio - which isn’t bad, thanks to a pair of stereo speakers.
The Mi6 is available in black, silver or blue, plus there's a ceramic version.
We have to say we’re inclined to agree with Apple’s claims that you don’t need Quad-HD: though you absolutely can tell the difference between full- and Quad-HD, so don’t believe all that ‘Retina’ BS, the Mi6 is perfectly clear at this resolution. This is not a screen you’d find yourself complaining about.
With increasing screen resolutions also comes increasing demands placed on the battery, of course, and this is a standout area for the Mi6, fitted as it is with a 3,350mAh cell that supports Quick Charge (but not wireless charging) and may even keep going two days. So the full-HD screen is a trade-off we’re more than happy to make - especially when that display is as bright (1- to 600 nits) and vibrant as this one, with great contrast, realistic colours and excellent viewing angles.
Xiaomi claims the Mi6 has four-sided glass, which isn’t as amazing - or confusing - as it sounds. Really it means it is curved on the corners as well as the edges, and only slightly - we’re not talking curved in the same sense as we are with the Galaxy S8.
The Mi6 is fitted with a 5.15in screen, features very slim screen bezels, and is just 7.5mm thick with almost slippery smooth, rounded edges at the rear that make it feel ever so comfortable in the hand. As manufacturers look to differentiate themselves on screen size and quality, with flagships that get larger with every new release, Xiaomi is sticking to its ground. This is a relatively compact phone that will be ideal for those customers who think the market is beginning to outgrow them.
Something else to consider is that different cellular frequencies are used in different countries across the globe, and these Chinese models may not necessarily work in your country of residence.
In the UK what we typically see with Xiaomi phones is that they don’t support the 800MHz/Band 20 frequency which is relied on by O2, Giffgaff, Sky Mobile and others for 4G connectivity. These customers will not receive anything faster than 3G connectivity without connecting to Wi-Fi, while customers of networks that support other 4G bands but also use 800MHz may find 4G coverage patchier than they have done previously.
We’ve outlined how to tell whether a phone is supported by your network here.
Another thing that can make Xiaomi phones a poor fit for UK customers is their lack of Google apps. This is not true of all Xiaomi devices, and wherever possible you should look to buy a ‘Global’ edition of a Xiaomi phone which will include access to the Google Play store and Google services out of the box. Some ‘International’ models also come with Google Play preinstalled, or allow you to install Google Services via the Mi App store.
Sadly, the International version of the Mi6 we have here does not come preinstalled with Google apps, and there’s no obvious way to add them. We’ve read that this may have something to do with MIUI 8.0, a custom version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow that is preinstalled on the Mi6, and if it is then there’s hope there will soon be a fix.
Of course we’ve found a workaround, but it is one that won’t appeal to less techy users. Something to keep in mind before you rush ahead and buy what looks to be the best-priced flagship of the year. Also see: Best mid-range phones 2017
The up side of that is you’ll pay nothing like as much for the Xiaomi Mi6 SIM-free as you would a flagship from the likes of Samsung, HTC, Sony and LG. You won’t get much change from £700 for those phones, but with the Mi6 you could almost buy two. It’s incredible to believe Xiaomi is able to offer such a great deal at what is in essence a mid-range price.
Our photo black Xiaomi Mi6 is the ‘International’ edition with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There’s also a version with 128GB storage (neither support expansion via microSD, though few people would find themselves low on space at this capacity) and a ceramic model with the same 18K gold detailing as seen on the revolutionary Mi Mix.
It was sent to us to review by GearBest, which is one of many Chinese companies offering to import tech to the UK and elsewhere. Pricing is just £381.91 ($479.99/438.16€) for 64GB and £429.65 ($539.99/492.93€) for 128GB, though you’ll need to also factor into your budget import duty. This is usually calculated at 20 percent of the value printed on the shipping paperwork, plus an admin fee of around £11.
The Mi6 should ship between 1 and 3 June 2017, though how long it will take to arrive depends on the shipping option you select (a free service is available). Also see: Best Android phones 2017 
A clear contender for snatching the crown for best Chinese phone, the successor to the Mi5 and Mi5s takes on design aspects from the Mi Note 2, adds a dual-camera and forward-facing features such as USB-C audio, and tops it all off with faster performance than anything we’ve seen yet.
While Samsung’s still debating whether to add a dual-camera or under-glass fingerprint scanner to its Galaxy line, Xiaomi’s already done it. And though it might lack the Quad-HD Infinity Display and curved-glass edges, the Xiaomi has a great screen and is a much more comfortable size to hold in one hand.

"Xiaomi made headlines early last year with its 2016 flagship, the Mi 5. Not only was the Mi 5 affordable, beautiful, and packed with top-tier features, it was also one of the first devices to sport Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 processor. Unfortunately the device never officially made its way to the United States, and even if you did manage to import one it lacked the proper 4G LTE bands.
The Mi 6 manages to stand out with its design. While it doesn’t stray too far from past Xiaomi phones, we still applaud the company for trying to be unique. The Mi 6 variant in this review is also the ceramic edition, which makes it quite a bit heavier than the standard glass model. Also, the ceramic model comes with the highest configuration of specifications (more on that later).
Below the display, you’ll find a set of capacitive back and recent apps keys, which flank the physical home button. The home button also doubles as a fingerprint sensor, and has proven to be fast and accurate in our experience. And, as an added bonus, the capacitive keys can also be customized in the settings menu.
Despite being a flagship device, the Mi 6 does fall behind the pack a bit with its 1080p display. This LCD isn’t bad in any regard, though Quad HD is very much a standard this year in high-end devices. However, Xiaomi has done a great job at making the LCD panel extremely bright in daylight, and also impressively dark when the slider is cranked to zero. This level of darkness is something we’d normally expect from AMOLED displays, but somehow Xiaomi was able to make it work with the Mi 6’s LCD panel.
You’ll also find the latest and greatest specs inside the Mi 6. Aside from the Galaxy S8 and HTC U11, the Mi 6 is one of the first devices to sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. It also comes with either 4 or 6 GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of on-board storage. As I alluded to earlier, the ceramic edition is considered the most premium of the bunch, as it comes with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage.
I’ve been using the Mi 6 to take tons of photos and videos, and I’ve also been using it as my main gaming device over the past few weeks. In both of these situations, I found no reason to doubt the performance and overall reliability of the phone
As I mentioned in the disclaimer, I unfortunately wasn’t able to use the device to its fullest on T-Mobile’s network here in the U.S., so I had to rely on Wi-Fi and tethering to get things done in many cases. However, call quality was adequate and was helped along by the dual speaker setup. In a configuration similar to last year’s HTC 10, a bottom mounted speaker is accompanied by a unit in the call speaker. Thus, the phone’s audio has some good stereo sound, but unfortunately doesn’t get all that loud. Things get better when connecting headphones, as a built-in EQ provides a nice amount of sound customization. However, you’ll have to keep the headphone jack adapter handy.
The biggest issue I ran into when reviewing the Mi 6 is assessing battery life, as the phone was only connected to T-Mobile via HSPA. I was able to make it to the end of the day on a single charge, but that could definitely change when connected to proper high speed internet.
Xiaomi is shipping the Mi 6 with its own custom version of Android, MIUI 8, atop Android 7.1.1 Nougat. And if you’re at all familiar with Xiaomi devices, you probably already know that MIUI doesn’t come with an app drawer, which means you’ll need to rely on folders to help organize your home screens. This is par for the course for many other Chinese ROMs, but users in the West might have a hard time getting used to it.
Some extra features include a Dual App mode that allows multiple iterations of the same application, a Deep Clean application that helps to clear the phone of junk files, and included Mi Cloud storage if you have a Mi account. If there’s one thing we always enjoy hearing about with MIUI, it’s how often it gets updated due to feedback in the Mi forums. All in all, if you’re familiar with MIUI (and, really, any Chinese ROM) there isn’t much else that differentiates this new version.
If you have been following the trend of this review, you may notice that the Xiaomi Mi 6 seems to take a lot of the best features from previous devices and puts them into one complete package. That’s definitely true for the camera, which is a dual lens system that provides a 2x optical zoom aside the original wider angle. Zoom can be quite important to shutterbugs and Xiaomi has done well to provide one for picture taking in particular. Zoom capabilities are unfortunately not available for video recording, which is a rather significant downside.
Throughout the testing period, I have enjoyed using the Xiaomi Mi 6 for video recording. Optical image stabilization helps keep all footage from looking too jittery, and there was a good amount of detail in each shot. Even though exposure might jump around from time to time, there was little to complain about other than the omission of zoom when in Movie Mode. I was told that this misstep is not a problem with the hardware and could be opened up in the future via a MIUI software update.
The camera software in the Mi 6 provides a few extra modes that shutterbugs will be particularly fond of, including a Pro mode. And even as an automatic shooter, the Mi 6’s camera is quick enough to take a good shot, even when shooting in HDR mode. HDR is a toggle rather than an automatic mode, and keeping it on will often boost up the shadows and bump up the saturation to a noticeable degree.
Pictures in broad daylight generally came out looking good, though the dynamic range left a bit to be desired. Highlights tend to be too bright when I tried to bring up the exposure compensation for better shadows. And this same overly bright effect was observed in HDR adjustments, too. While zooming into elements without a loss in quality is a nice option to have, but it wasn’t required in a ton of situations.
That is, until you use the marquee feature of the Xiaomi Mi 6 camera – Portrait Mode. Heavily inspired by the iPhone Portrait Mode, Xiaomi utilizes the optical zoom to tighten up the frame while working to isolate the subject from the background. When subjects are, at most, a couple of meters away, the phone goes right into a Depth Effect mode, adding bokeh to the background elements.
The Mi 6 does a decent job of this as it softens out the edges, but it does sometimes cut the line a bit incorrectly. This is only really noticeable when zooming in; taken on their own, the portrait photos turned out to be the most enjoyable part of the camera experience. Especially in good lighting, photos of friends and colleagues yielded new-profile-picture-level shots. Lower light situations make these and pretty much any other photo suffer especially in the finer details of the pictures, making this a less than ideal indoor or nighttime camera.
Much like the Portrait Mode, it is when the phone focuses on a specific feature or capability that it manages to provide some high points. However, trying to do too much just bogs down the overall package. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is by far the most capable phone Xiaomi has made to date (the “most unique” title goes to the Mi MIX, of course). But in its quest to provide every feature we’ve loved in the last couple years, it falls just short of perfection.
The dual speaker is a bit reserved, the battery is big but sacrifices the headphone jack, and the dual camera isn’t as capable as we would like. It’s a give and take with the Xiaomi Mi 6, and it comes right down to its price — a price that is equivalent to $360. That’s an incredible price that would make anyone in the West excited, only it’s not available anywhere but the opposite side of the world.
Even with the cons, the pros are stacked with the price point leading the way. It might not be perfect as a flagship, but if you can get your hands on it, this amalgam of features could be one of the best bang for buck phones in existence.
So we hope that Xiaomi expands further with their next phone as long as they continue this trend of selling their phones at as close to cost as possible. Xiaomi has made strides with the Mi Note 2 that was globally capable and then the limited release Mi MIX that made a big splash. If this ceramic Mi 6 came with the global radios, Xiaomi could have a hit.
Even though we’re using the latest version of MIUI on the Mi 6, the core experience hasn’t changed much at all over the years.
In Android Authority’s own battery testing app, the Mi 6 was able to achieve about seven hours of continuous screen-on usage using a mixture of gaming, browsing, and video playback. In my personal usage, I was able to get close to six hours of screen-on time primarily on my home Wi-Fi network. And when I was running low on a charge, Quick Charge 3.0 helped keep the Mi 6’s battery topped off throughout the day.
Overall I didn’t have any issues with the display, though sometimes I did have trouble finding the brightness slider in dark environments. Trust me, this display gets really dark when the slider is turned all the way down.
There’s one more major design decision worth pointing out here, and that’s the lack of a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Though it is a controversial move, Xiaomi says removing it allowed them to include a bigger 3,350 mAh battery.
The ceramic shines beautifully and is complemented by small gold accents – 18K gold accents, to be exact. Yes, Xiaomi seems to spare no expense when it comes to the materials of this phone, but it almost makes you wonder how the retail price could be so low. Nevertheless, it feels incredibly premium and hefty, but can slip around in the hand a little too much. However, there is a case included that helps a bit with the handling.
Now Xiaomi is back with its 2017 flagship smartphone, the Mi 6. With the Xiaomi Mi 6, you get a phone with high-end specs, a unique design, a zoom lens, and a sub-$400 price tag. The problem is, like the Mi 5, this phone isn’t coming to the West. That means folks residing in the U.S. will need to import one from a third-party website. But if you happen to live elsewhere, is this phone worth your hard-earned cash?

"Anyone looking for a powerful high-end smartphone now, should take a closer look at the Xiaomi Mi6. For about 400 Euros (~$450), Xiaomi's flagship smartphone offers quite a lot, except for LTE-band-20 support. As our test shows, the sixth generation of the Mi series also cannot keep up with the high-end competition in one respect.
As expected, the Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi have also updated their Mi series this year, presenting the sixth Test Xiaomi Mi6 Smartphone generation of their in-house high-end series. The biggest changes of this year's product update have been under the hood, since the outside appearance has changed very little compared to the Mi5 and Mi5s. 
The Xiaomi Mi6 is available in three different color variants, black, blue and silver, and a black ceramic version with golden adornments around the camera lens. Not only has the screen diagonal of the Mi6 remained the same compared to the predecessor, but all the dimensions of the device are almost identical. The curved edges and slim form of merely 8 mm (~0.31 in) thickness make the Xiaomi device fit in the hand very well. Compared with the predecessor, the case appears even more ergonomic and of higher quality. The high weight of 168 g (5.9 oz) – the ceramic version is even 14 grams (0.49 oz) heavier is rather surprising for such a compact device. The edges around the IPS display are a little large for our tastes. At barely 72%, the Mi6 has a considerably more inefficient display-surface ratio than the 2017 high-end competition, the LG G6 or the Samsung Galaxy S8.
The internal UFS-2.1 storage of our test unit has a capacity of 64 GB, with only 51.6 GB remaining for the user at the time of delivery. The storage of the dual-SIM smartphone cannot be extended.
In terms of system software, Xiaomi uses the MiUI operating system version 8.3, which is based on the current Google Android version 7.1. Since the Xiaomi-Mi devices are really only designed for the Chinese market, the in-house MiUI software does not really support Google services such as the Play Store or Google apps such as Gmail as it comes from the factory. Instead, Chinese services and Xiaomi's own services are used. However, there is a global version (Beta) which supports Google services and as well as Chinese and English, other languages (such as German) are available as the system language.
The integrated WLAN module masters the IEEE-802.11 standard according to a/b/g/n/ac. In addition, the Mi6 knows the 2x2-MIMO technology, enabling very high transfer rates. The transfer speeds that we measured between the smartphone and our Linksys EA 8500 reference router can be called excellent at 574 MBit/s (iperf server) and 500 MBit/s (iperf client). In everyday usage, the reception is also good and the WLAN signal is mostly stable, apart from some occasional drops. In close proximity to the router (Telekom Speedport, W921V) we measured a very low damping of -28 dBm. 
To locate the position, the Mi6 uses the global GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou satellite navigation systems. The position can even be located indoors with the high-end smartphone, however it is not very accurate. Outdoors, the results are much better and also much faster. To evaluate the accuracy of the location capabilities of our test device in practice, we record a route with Garmin Edge 500 GPS bicycle computer and our smartphone in parallel for comparison. In our GPS test, the Mi6 deviates by a mere 70 meters from the professional GPS device, although we can see some small inaccuracies as in the bridge area. Based on the measured data, we can infer an excellent accuracy in daily use. 
The voice reproduction and the sound and call quality of the ear speaker are quite satisfactory. The maximum volume achieved ensures that the conversation partner can be understood easily. The sound quality of the built-in microphone has also been reported by our conversation partner as clear and easily understandable.
The main camera in the back of the Mi6 has a Sony Exmor RS sensor with a resolution of 12 MP in the 4:3 format (3968x2976 pixels). The IMX386 CMOS image sensor of the Japanese manufacturer has pixels that measure 1.25 μm edge to edge. The camera module has a focal distance of 27 mm (~1.1 in), an aperture of f/1.8, and a 4-axis OIS for image stabilization. The second camera on the back also has a resolution of 12 MP. However, the Samsung S5K3M3 image sensor has only an f/2.6 aperture and 1.0-µm pixel edge size. The 12-MP camera records videos in a 4K maximum resolution at 30 FPS. In addition slow-motion recordings are possible at 120 FPS in 720p.
Besides the test unit, the box contains quick-start instructions, a modular charger, and a USB charging cable. In addition, Xiaomi includes a transparent plastic protective case with the Mi6. Earphones are not included. 
The capacitive multi-touchscreen reacts quickly and reliably up to the display edges. Moreover, the Corning Gorilla-4 glass surface has very good gliding characteristics. In terms of reliability and reaction time, there is nothing to complain.
As already in the Mi5, the IPS display of the Mi6 offers a Full HD resolution of 1920x1080 pixels in a 5.15-inch diagonal. This leads to a 428 PPI pixel density. Whether in a 2017 high-end smartphone with this display size, a WQHD-resolution (2560x1440 pixels) is necessary, is a matter of taste. In our opinion, the contents are displayed sufficiently sharp. 
The combination of display brightness and a black value of 0.28 cd/m² results in an excellent contrast ratio of 1:2214. However, our APL-50 measurements reduce the high contrast, since the black value in evenly distributed bright and dark areas increases to 0.48 cd/m² (contrast 1:1246). 
With the Snapdragon 835 (8998), Xiaomi uses one of the most powerful processors currently on the market. The Qualcomm SoC was one of the first chips manufactured in 10 nm, and it integrates 8 CPU cores of the in-house Kryo architecture with 64-Bit support.
Due to the 10-nm manufacturing process, the Adreno 540 graphics unit integrated into the Qualcomm SoC clocks at a frequency (710 MHz) that is about 13% higher than that of the Adreno-530 GPU. Graphically demanding games from the Android Play Store such as the “Asphalt Xtreme” or “Airborne” racing games and the “Dead Trigger 2” ego-shooter can be played and displayed smoothly on the Mi6 without any problems. The charging times are also pleasantly short. 
With the help of one speaker next to the ear and a second at the bottom of the device, the Mi6 produces a stereo sound when playing music or videos. The two speakers together offer a pleasant quality with a maximum volume of 82 dB(A). While the speaker above the display has a volume that is slightly lower and rather conveys the highs, the speaker at the bottom of the device is louder and also more powerful. 
The power management of the Xiaomi smartphone is exemplary in idle operation as well as under load. Only the Samsung Galaxy S8 does better in our measurements. 
The built-in battery is rated at 3350 mAh. Thanks to the Quick-Charge 3.0 support, if the battery is empty, it is quickly charged again. In our practically relevant WLAN test with a brightness of 150 cd/m², the Mi6 achieves a very good value of 12 hours and 19 minutes.
With their new high-end smartphone, Xiaomi succeeds in creating a good update in the Mi-series. Compared to the predecessor, the Chinese manufacturer has turned the right adjustment screws. The display, storage, technical equipment, connectivity, and the battery life have improved. Moreover, it fits better in the hand and is relatively compact due to the unchanged dimensions. In addition, the Mi6 offers stereo sound because of the second speaker next to the ear - similar to what we see in the HTC devices. The camera continues to remain an issue where we see room for improvement, although the dual-camera is by no means bad.
Of course there are also minor complaints, such as the slightly high deviations in the color and grayscale display of the IPS panel, the weight that is quite high, the missing IP certification, or the unsupported Qi standard for wireless charging. The internal storage also cannot be expanded. However, compared to the local high-end competition, Xiaomi creates a really interesting overall package, if you consider the affordable purchase price of about 400 Euros (~$450) – during our test period it was even considerably below that at times. But an import with the connected restrictions and risks is not the right path to a new smartphone for everyone. 
As expected, the sound is dominated by sounds of the mid and high frequencies. The pink noise diagram shows that the bass is hardly audible, but the mids and highs are reproduced in a very linear fashion.
Compared to the mono-speaker competition (Samsung Galaxy S8 or LG G6), the quality of the two speakers of the Mi6 ranges on a very good level. The stereo effect in particular is a great advantage in everyday life. 
The system performance and the browser speed of the Mi6 are excellent. Thanks to the ability to deactivate the system animations in the settings menu, the subjective system speed of the Mi6 is remarkably fast. There are no long load times or stutters, and apps also close quickly due to the fast UFS storage. In the AndroBench-3 test, the access rates are on the same level as the high-end competition. 
The performance in the synthetic benchmarks is also excellent, and the results often form a new reference in our measurements. In the AnTuTu-v6 benchmark in particular, the Mi6 achieves a very high value above 180,000 points. The integrated Adreno 540 graphics unit also sets up some records at one or the other in the graphics-heavy tests. 
The display analysis with a photo spectrometer and the CalMAN software shows quite high deviations of the color (4.8) and grayscale display (5.3) compared to the competition. Moreover, the display's color temperature of 7473 Kelvin is slightly too cool, which results in a slight blue tint in practice.
At a maximum of 620 cd/m², the panel brightness is very high. Furthermore, it is illuminated very evenly at 89%. However, the full illumination of the Mi6 (625 cd/m²) is only available when the surrounding light sensor is activated. In our APL50 measurement, which is closer to reality and simulates an even distribution of bright and dark areas on the IPS panel, it is still 598 cd/m². 
At a very low brightness level, from 20% on we could measure screen flickering in a quite high frequency of 2315 Hz.
Navigation is done with two illuminated capacitive keys below the display and a touch sensitive home button that has an integrated active fingerprint scanner. Its recognition rate is good, but often the finger has to be placed again on the sensor in order to be recognized. Overall the sensor reacts similarly fast and reliably as in Samsung's Galaxy-S models. 
Furthermore, TradingShenzhen added an EU adapter for the outlets used here; however, this is not part of the standard delivery but an additional service by the provider.
Xiaomi offers a global warranty of 12 months for their smartphones. 
As with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, the Xiaomi Mi6 offers a two-times optical zoom and a dual-camera mode with Bokeh effects for pictures. In bright lighting conditions, the two camera modules ensure very sharp pictures rich in detail. However, the dynamic range is considerably smaller than in the LG G6. Moreover, the recorded colors appear slightly pale, and bright areas are slightly overexposed. Compared to the predecessor, the Mi6 can take very decent photos in daylight, though. 
Despite the wide aperture of f/1.8, the Mi6 cannot really convince under dark light conditions. Even through the absolute brightness in the pictures is sufficient, the sharpness is not optimal, and a strong image noise dominates the pictures.
The Sony IMX268 image sensor of the front camera has a resolution of 8 MP. The 80-degree wide angle selfies can score with a good quality if sufficient light is available. Unfortunately, the module lacks an auto-focus for optimal image sharpness. The front camera records videos in Full HD resolution (1920x1080 pixels) at up to 30 images per second. 
The Xiaomi Mi6 supports using up to two Nano-SIM cards simultaneously. The Gigabit-LTE smartphone accesses the mobile Internet at up to 1 GB/s during downloads - this goes for both SIM card slots. However, the frequency coverage is not optimal, particularly in rural areas in Germany since the LTE band 20 is not supported. To our question, TradingShenzhen who provided our test unit responded that a global version of the Mi6 that would also cover the 800 MHz frequencies was not planned. 
For wireless near-field communication, the user has an NFC chip as well as the most current version 5.0 of Bluetooth. However, the latter can only be used to the full extent with the Android O update.
The user interface of the operating system is hardly reminiscent of stock Android. Even in its 8th version, MiUI is very colorful, which feels a little overloaded, but offers a lot of adjustment settings. The installed apps are not collected in an App Drawer, but spread over the various home screens. The design can be changed by the user to suite their individual tastes through the in-house Theme Store.
During our testing period - we used the global version (Beta 7.5.18) on our Mi6 – there were interruptions in the WLAN and some Google app crashes, particularly Gmail.
The 3350 mAh battery is charged via USB 3.0 Type-C port at the bottom of the device. With an OTG adapter, peripheral devices such as external keyboards or USB sticks can be connected to the USB port. Headphones can also be connected via the USB port - you will look in vain for a 3.5-mm audio port in the Mi6.
The other features of the Mi6 include a fingerprint sensor, stereo speakers, Wi-Fi Direct, an infrared sensor, a compass, and a status LED. The wireless transfer of the display contents to an external monitor via Miracast is also supported and worked well in our test with an Android TV by Sony.  
The keys for the volume adjustment and on/off on the right side of the case are easy to reach and have a comfortable pressure point. However, the keys are not sitting as tightly in the case as in a Samsung Galaxy S8 or the HTC U Ultra. Like Samsung, Xiaomi has also omitted a home button in these years. Instead, there is a capacitive sensor positioned in the center. 
As with its predecessor, the Xiaomi Mi6 has a 5.15-inch IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. To supply the power, a 3350-mAh battery is built-in, which gives us hope for a very good battery life considering the display size. Inside the dual-SIM smartphone a Snapdragon 835, which is currently the most powerful processor by Qualcomm, provides the necessary performance. Furthermore, there are 6 GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of UFS-2.1 memory.
For the first time, Xiaomi has built a dual camera system into one of their flagship devices. It consists of two 12-Megapixel cameras. The second camera module on the back of the device collects depth information which provides the photos with the so-called Bokeh effect. Moreover, the Mi6 is Xiaomi's first smartphone that is protected against water splashes.
The manufacturer's top model has 128 GB of internal storage and a ceramic back (~ 520 Euros/ ~$582; it currently costs around $600 in the US). For our test, we were provided with the variant of the Xiaomi Mi6 with 64 GB and a glass back (~ 400 Euros/ ~$450; starting at $440 in the US). The glass model is also available with a 128 GB of memory for an extra charge of about 70 Euros (~$78). There is no direct distribution planned for the European market, so that the Mi6 can only be purchased from importing vendors.
Possible competitors of the Xiaomi high-end smartphone and comparison devices in our test are the current smartphone elite of the Honor 8 Pro, the Samsung Galaxy S8, the LG G6, and the Huawei P10. Added are other representatives of the high-end such as the OnePlus 3T and the HTC U Ultra, which are available for similar prices.

"Empezamos por uno de los apartados mas peliagudos cuando hablamos de Xiaomi, y no por la inestabilidad o por su mal software, sino porque con los nuevos lanzamientos, estamos siempre a expensas de que ROM va a tener el dispositivo. A día de hoy, finales de mayo, solo hay ROM Oficial en Chino e ingles, MIUI 8.2.17.0 basada en Android 7.1.1 con parche de seguridad del 1/4/2017, esta es la ROM es la que nos ha traído el terminal, y pese a que le hemos conseguido instalar los servicios de Google gracias a ayuda de otros usuarios Hilo de HTCMania , nos ha dado problemas con varias aplicaciones que no dejaba instalar o arrancar, entre ellas Netflix sin la cual muchos no podemos vivir. En algún caso puede que la tienda lo mande con una ROM con traducción al castellano, pero no será la oficial con lo que no tendremos actualizaciones de parte de Xiaomi.
Aparte del cambio de ROM, Miui es una de los sistemas mas maduros y completos, y sobre el Xiaomi Mi6 vuela literalmente, una maravilla, además si estás acostumbrado al doble escritorio o a duplicar aplicaciones, MIUI es un sistema muy sencillo para manejar y completo de opciones, con una experiencia de usuario que, aunque para gustos los colores, pocas capas pueden igualar.
En lo referente al diseño del terminal, lo tenemos acabo en metal y cristal en esta versión de 64GB de almacenamiento, con tres posibles colores,** negro, blanco y violeta**, mientras que la versión de 128GB ""Exclusive"" tiene acabado en cerámica, como ya veíamos en el anterior Mi5 y es exclusivamente negro, con el reborde de las lentes de ambas cámaras en oro. Este terminal nos recuerda a anteriores dispositivos, por un lado, el frontal es muy parecido al Mi5S con su botón central con lector de huella incorporado, mientras que la trasera me recuerda al Mi5 con esos bordes más redondeados.
La pantalla es una IPS en resolución FULL HD 1920x1080, lo que da 428 dpi de densidad, una pantalla de muy buena calidad, se ve bien al sol, los colores son muy naturales, nada saturados, podríamos achacar en todo caso a Xiaomi que no haya optado por una resolución mayor, cosa que ya hacen sus competidores en los gamas altas con resoluciones 2K, pero no olvidemos que estamos ante un dispositivo de 5.15"".
La ausencia del jack de 3.5mm se solventa con el adaptador que ha incluido Xiaomi, no disponemos de cascos USB-C para probarlos. Uno de los problemas que te vas a encontrar es si escuchas audio con cascos y quieres a la vez cargar el Xiaomi Mi6, tendrás el conector ocupado, existe unos duplicadores de USB-C a USB-C y mini jack que podréis encontrar en Aliexpress o Amazon. El sonido es muy bueno, potente y sin distorsionar un buen trabajo de Xiaomi.
El punto estrella del nuevo Xiaomi Mi6 es la incorporación del Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 con la GPU Adreno 540 y 6GB de RAM (dejando libres unos 4GB). El sistema vuela, juegos pesados los mueve sin problemas incluso con varias aplicaciones abiertas simultáneamente, hemos pasado los benchmark mas comunes y los resultados impresionantes, alcanzando los 180.000 puntos en antutu. Estamos ante un procesador de 10 nm, en el que Qualcomm ha querido buscar la máxima potencia compensada con un consumo de batería equilibrado cosa que ha conseguido. No se ha calentado tampoco al jugar durante 20 minutos ha pasado de 35º a 42º, el único pero que le podemos sacar es que al jugar al GTA, en ocasiones saca polígonos con textura blanca, podéis verlo en el vídeo de Test de juegos que está mas abajo.
El Xiaomi Mi6 tampoco defrauda en el apartado fotográfico, en la parte trasera con su doble cámara, Xiaomi incorpora un sensor principal Sony IMX386 de 12MP con apertura f/1.8 y un sensor secundario de Samsung, la cámara, aprovecha estos dos sensores para disponer de un zoom óptico de 2X. Las fotos de día son espectaculares, tal vez demasiado saturados los colores, pero hemos sacado comparativa con el Galaxy S7 y sale bien parado el Mi6, abajo os dejamos alguna comparativa.
En cuanto al vídeo, tenemos grabación en cámara lenta a 120fps a 720 y grabación en fullHd y 4K a 30fps, no tiene opción de grabar a 60fps, la cámara frontal también permite grabar vídeo hasta en FullHD. La parte que más nos ha gustado es la grabación a 4K, el enfoque en vídeo es rápido (ver ejemplo) y la cancelación de ruido del micrófono funciona muy bien (hace viento en el video de ejemplo FullHD y casi no se nota), pero la cámara lenta nos ha decepcionado, lo he intentado varias veces pero no da la sensación de llegar a enfocar bien en ningún momento.
La aplicación de la cámara, de sobra conocida para usuarios de Xiaomi, con las opciones de filtros (Rustico, Color Pop, Glacial...), HDR y cambio de cámaras directamente en la pantalla, dentro del menú modo encontramos las opciones de audio, visualización, panorama y activar modo manual, donde podemos jugar con los parámetros de la cámara. Curiosamente te añade una marca de agua por defecto, que tienes que desactivar desde los ajustes.
En el apartado de conectividad, dispone de dos ranuras Nano SIM, es un Dual Standby y al no ser una versión Internacional no soporta la banda B20 de 800Mhz, algo que sucede en muchos terminales chinos y que no es un problema en España, ya que soporta las otras bandas 4G y solo puede ser una pega si estamos en una zona que solo llegue la 800. La conexión es estable, buena velocidad de descarga en 4G. Ningún problema tampoco en las llamadas, un sonido nítido y sin problemas de cobertura.
Nos encontramos con una batería de 3350mAh Li-Polymer no extraible al tratarse de un terminal unibody con carga rápida Quick Charge 3.0. El Xiaomi Mi6 nos ha dejado impresionado, la primera prueba que he pasado, es dejarle reproducir video en Youtube con el brillo al máximo, dándome unos resultados de mas de 7 horas de pantalla.
Un excelente terminal, si quieres potencia, batería, una cámara diurna decente, un buen sonido y no buscas una pantalla grande, el Xiaomi Mi6 es tu móvil. Una de las mejores opciones en cuanto calidad precio.
Podemos sacarle pequeñas pegas, led de notificaciones multicolor, radio FM, jack 3.5mm etc, falta de banda B20, pero nada que sea grave. Esperemos que tengamos una ROM global para que no tengas que recurrir a desbloqueo, TWRP, etc que es el único problema que va a tener un usuario no avanzado si adquiere este terminal y quiere tenerlo actualizado.
En el uso cotidiano, con brillo automático, uso de datos navegación , redes sociales, etc, pasaba de largo las 7 horas y media y me ha dado prácticamente 2 días de uso del móvil. La carga de 0 a 100 la ha realizado en hora y media, también un buen tiempo para poder disponer de batería para rato, además como suele suceder, carga más rápido al principio que la parte final de la batería.
En cuanto a Wifi, soporta dual band a 2.4GHz y 5GHz, la cobertura Wifi correcta, un poco mejor que otros dispositivos (Oneplus X, Nubia N1, Xiaomi Mi4I) pero tampoco mucho más de señal. Permite Wifi Display, habréis podido ver en el video de test de juegos que estaba transmitiendo a la tele sin problema. Dispone de NFC, no hemos tenido posibilidad de probar NFC para pagos pero no deberíamos tener problemas. La aplicación de mando a distancia me ha funcionado correctamente en una TV Sony y en una LG, algo de agradecer que se mantenga el puerto de infrarrojos, pena de no poder decir lo mismo de la Radio FM que no está disponible en este Xiaomi Mi6.
Respecto al GPS, me ha localizado con una precisión de más menos 4 m a cielo abierto un día despejado en unos segundos. Viene con Bluetooth 5.0, actualización de protocolo que permite conexión a mayores distancias, menos consumo de batería y mejora del ancho de banda a 2 Mbit/s. De sensores viene muy completo, proximidad, giroscopio, acelerómetro, luz, etc.
El modo retrato es notable, os ponemos algún ejemplo.
En las fotos con baja la luz se defiende mejor que el Mi5S, capta luz para poder sacar unas fotos nocturnas aunque con ruido y con un postprocesado que genera unos colores distorsionados.
El almacenamiento como ya hemos comentado es de 64GB, existe una versión superior de 128GB, no dispone de ranura de almacenamiento MicroSD, con 64GB para la gran mayoría será suficiente, pero si necesitas más espacio tendrás que comprar el de 128GB.
La parte frontal en el inferior, además del botón táctil con el lector (rápido y preciso, con unos 30 intentos seguidos solo con un par de fallos por no poner muy bien el dedo), dispone de dos led para los otros dos botones, que se encienden al usar el móvil, y en la parte superior la cámara frontal, el altavoz y el led de notificaciones mono color blanco junto con el sensor de proximidad.
En la parte trasera, tenemos el logo de Xiaomi, el flash dual led bitono y la doble cámara. En el lateral derecho el botón de encendido y los de volumen y en el izquierdo la ranura de las dos tarjetas Nano SIM. La parte inferior cuenta con el conector USB-C, el altavoz y micrófono y en la superior el sensor de infrarrojos.
Las dimensiones son muy cómodas para el uso al ser un terminal de 5.15"", 14,5cm*7cm lo que nos da una superficie útil del 70% un valor normal en estas dimensiones. De grosor son 7,5mm, y cuenta con un peso de 168g , no es de los más ligeros pero se usa sin problemas.
Como siempre en MIUI, tendremos que jugar con la aplicación de seguridad, dando permisos a las aplicaciones que queremos que no mate el sistema y también permitir que accedan a las notificaciones para evitar que perdamos avisos de las aplicaciones de mensajería. Si queréis ayuda, tenemos un post con indicaciones para solucionar notificaciones en MIUI.
El led de notificaciones, solo de color blanco nos sirve para indicar que está cargando o avisar de notificaciones, no tiene más colores con lo cual no podemos cambiar los colores para los avisos de la aplicación que queramos priorizar. Las aplicaciones Chinas de la ROM oficial China pueden desinstalarse, quedándonos una ROM limpia aunque con los problemas que hemos comentado anteriormente.
