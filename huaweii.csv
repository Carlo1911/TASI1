The P10 is the smaller of the two devices, as it sports a 5.1-inch display with Full HD resolution. You’ll find a Kirin 960 chipset under the hood along with 4 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of storage that can be expanded with a microSD card. It features a dual-camera setup on the back (20 MP + 12 MP), a selfie snapper with an 8 MP sensor, and a 3,200 mAh battery, running Android 7.0 Nougat with the latest version of Huawei’s user interface on top.;http://www.androidauthority.com/android-7-0-features-673002/
;
The Huawei P10 offers a bigger 5.5-inch QHD display and packs a 3,750 mAh battery. The smartphone also features a slightly better primary camera and more storage — 64 GB. The rest of the specs are identical to those of the P10.;http://www.androidauthority.com/android-7-0-features-673002/

Huawei took the wraps off the P10 and P10 Plus at Mobile World Congress 2017 in February. As a refresher, the P10 sports a 5.1-inch display with Full HD resolution and is powered by the Kirin 960 chipset. It has 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage, and comes equipped with a dual-camera setup on the back (20 MP + 12 MP). There’s also a selfie snapper on board that has an 8 MP sensor.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-bringing-p10-p10-plus-canada-june-6-775155/

The Huawei P10 lite comes with a Full HD 5.2-inch IPS display and 2.5D glass. According to my testing the display is capable of 445 nits of brightness and according to the specs it has a contrast ratio of 1500:1. That 1,920×1,080 resolution yields a very decent 423 pixels per inch.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-lite-review-764800/
;
The display is plenty bright enough for indoors and it is still usable outdoors, however at only 445 nits it could struggle in very bright direct sunlight. You can change the color temperature of the display in the Settings menu to be a little warmer or cooler to better suit your tastes, but for me the default settings were good enough.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-lite-review-764800/
;
The Huawei P10 lite features an in-house Kirin 658 SoC built on 16nm FinFET. It is a slightly beefed up version of the Kirin 650 found in the Huawei P9 lite. It has an octa-core CPU configuration with four Cortex-A53 cores, clocked at 2.36 GHz and another four clocked at 1.7 GHz. The chip also features a Mali-T830 MP2 GPU.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-lite-review-764800/
;
There are two variations of the device, depending on the particular model and region. There’s a 32 GB version with 3 GB of RAM and another 32 GB version with 4 GB of RAM. It seems that Western Europe, Northern Africa, Southeast Asia, and APAC get the 4 GB version, while the rest of the world gets the 3 GB version.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-lite-review-764800/
;
Although the Cortex-A53 is designed more for power efficiency than peak performance, the P10 lite still feels fast and fluid. The UI animations are smooth, apps open and close quickly, and with 4 GB of RAM multi-tasking is a breeze.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-lite-review-764800/
;
The Huawei P10 lite runs Android 7.0 out of the box, complete with Huawei’s Emotion UI 5.1. The biggest gripe that people seem to have with EMUI is the lack of an app drawer, however that should no longer be an issue as Huawei has included the ability to change the home screen to include an app drawer!;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-lite-review-764800/
;
You get a 12 MP rear camera with a 1.25 micron pixel size on a 1/1.28 inch sensor. While Huawei claims things like “20 percent more light” the truth is that a 1/1.28 inch sensor is tiny, even by smartphone standards. Having said that, I am impressed with the photos this device can take, especially those in good day light conditions. As expected, the camera struggles in lower lighting, but not as badly as I had feared. The images can be grainy and colors often appear more muted than in better lit conditions.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-lite-review-764800/
;
The 8 MP front-facing camera is also solid enough, and should make selfie junkies happy. You will find a standard beautification mode available, plus the Perfect Selfie mode, which allows you to tinker with your selfie portraits with options to enlarge your eyes and thin your face!;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-lite-review-764800/

The P10 and P10 Plus, like their forebears, bring a solid metal construction with very impressive build quality. However, this time, there’s a bit more curvature to their smooth sides and corners. Rather than the old chamfered edge on the back, both phones have a slightly rounder edge that curves nicely onto the back of the device.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-review-752932/
;
As with most contemporary smartphones in their first week of use, the P10 and P10 Plus (which, in our case is the 128GB version equipped with 6GB of RAM rather than the 4GB found in other P10 models) didn’t skip a beat. Both devices were luxuriously lag and stutter free with no app crashes, restarts or any other unexpected behavior.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-review-752932/
;
Even on the P10 with its 3,200mAh battery, our custom battery test predicted just over five and a half hours of screen-on time and I had similarly impressive results to Josh, managing to regularly eke out at least five hours screen-on time thanks to the P10’s lower resolution screen. Unlike some previous P series phones, you shouldn’t find yourself scrounging around for a charger mid-afternoon.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-review-752932/
;
On the P10 you’ll get a regular 12MP Summarit-H lens at f/2.2 aperture, backed up by a 20MP monochrome sensor that does the work of getting depth and detail information before color is inserted into the scene. The P10 Plus gets a bump to Summilux-H lenses at f/1.8 aperture for even better low light performance and shallow depth of field photography. As you may have seen, DxOMark gave very high scores to the P10 camera recently, so it probably won’t come as much of a surprise to know that we also found Huawei’s latest camera offering to be really good.;http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p10-review-752932/
