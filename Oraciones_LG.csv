The front that we have seen in the analysis of the LG G6 shows an exceptional use of this with a screen that is very close to 80 which is within reach of very few,['screen']
Obviously this makes the Android control buttons are integrated into the screen which is not exactly a problem,['screen']
The importance of this detail is a lot for the manufacturer since in the presentation of the MWC they put much emphasis on it and the benefits it offers as the best use of the split screen or the power to manipulate the buttons and shortcuts with greater comfort,['screen']
In addition the edges of the screen have no corners or edges which makes it maintain the new style of constant curves and the truth is that it allows the feeling of having a different and almost unique model,['screen']
We refer to the processor,['processor']
This may limit the desire effect in some but the combination with its 4 GB of RAM maybe integrating six would have drawn attention to this side allows to offer excellent performance in general at least with the current rivals who arrive in the future is by See but things will not be exactly simple,['ram']
And the future Well when it arrives we will see but a better processor always brings more power that is an unquestionable reality,['processor']
The rear camera consists of two lenses that have different angles but with resolution of 13 megapixels in both cases 71 degrees F 1 8 and 125 F 2,['camera']
The camera control application is one of the best in the market where there are options of all kinds and a Pro Mode is allowed as it can not be otherwise and in addition you can save in RAW the photos that are made,['camera']
Learning to handle the development is very simple what is a great success and to emphasize the Square Camera Mode that allows to make compositions type collage and that is striking and useful we ended up using it in a very habitual way,['camera']
This is different and takes full advantage of the screen options of the LG G6,['screen']
That yes the power does not lack the phone as well as a display of good quality and additions that we have liked much as the protection against water and dust,['display']
That yes maybe some more RAM and internal storage that stays in 32 gigas would have been nice to draw more attention,"['ram', 'storage']"
And including a good rear camera the self of the self does not reach its level and this is noted,['camera']
Very good quality screen,['screen']
High responsive rear camera,['camera']
By the way a detail that we must comment the front camera of 5 megapixels F 2,['camera']
If the screen is abused the terminal suffers here but the 3,['screen']
300 mAh battery amperage does not fade as at first you can believe it to be clear that the display is 5 7 inches,"['battery', 'display']"
By the way we do not appreciate any problem of delay by the new ratio of the screen what is positive,['screen']
These are the results obtained in the performance tests that we usually handle in MovilZona. The screen does not lack protection Gorilla Glass and therefore is very complete in general lines,['screen']
The quality of the images shown on the screen is very good with a very accurate color definition with excessive contrast at times and an excellent response,['screen']
It is worth buying the LG G6 or it is advisable to wait for the arrival of the high-end of other manufacturers To try to shed some light throughout this review of the LG G6 we are going to explore all the details of the smartphone to understand what it supposes in the Practice having a screen of 18 9,['screen']
Of course we will measure the level of your camera both day and night and examine its performance especially by incorporating a processor that is no longer the most powerful within the Android universe,"['camera', 'processor']"
The most obvious is the loss of removable battery one of the characteristics most applauded by LG G5 users but it seems to have the days counted within the high range except surprise there will be no flagship with this functionality throughout 2017,['battery']
In the back part of course the double camera that does not protrude a millimeter another advantage with respect to the LG G5 of which we will speak in depth later,['camera']
The front has little to do with the rest of the phones on the market as the screen gains a huge weight by relegating the edges to the minimum of its expression especially on the sides,['screen']
A design with an extraordinary body ratio higher than 78 which allows us to enjoy a screen of 5 7 inches in a smartphone in which we would usually find a panel of 5 2 inches to the point that the dimensions of the LG G6 are even Below those we saw in the LG G5,['screen']
The decision to bet on a screen with format 18 9 in what we will stop in depth in the next section allows design level to cut the width of the device,['screen']
Turn to one of the central sections of this analysis of the LG G6 that boasts a screen that looks very different from all others since it has a format of 18 9 2 1 instead of the conventional 16 9 that we find in most Of smartphones,['screen']
So far the theory is now to explain what happens in practice with the screen FullVision LG G6,['screen']
However when it comes to playing content in 16 9 we will have to choose between staying with some black bars on the sides or opting for the rescaling which as we said before can result in us missing some of the important information on the screen,['screen']
Of course we have an always on screen mode that allows us to check the notifications of the phone without having to turn on the screen,"['screen', 'screen']"
A very high quality technical screen with an incredible contrast that has little to envy the OLED panels with HDR technology without just frames an aspect ratio 18 9 that is a delight when consuming multimedia contents and rounded edges,['screen']
The philosophy is intuited in the own unlocking screen formed by two identical squares 11 that will be the way to visualize several of the basic applications of the telephone,['screen']
This is what we experience for example in the music player or in the calendar that with this new formula is much more practical because with the landscape screen can easily see the appointments and meetings each day,['screen']
In addition we can modify the position of the virtual buttons on screen having the option to include up to five,['screen']
The strength at software level of the LG G6 however comes out with the split screen that allows us to open two applications at the same time,['screen']
We have the option to make a screen bigger than another or to occupy the 50 of the screen which is especially useful if for example we are interested in having the application of notes open while we play a YouTube video,"['screen', 'screen']"
At first we can only open some applications in split screen but we have some tricks at hand,['screen']
For example we can open two web pages with Google Chrome if selecting the split screen mode with Chrome click on the option to open a link in a new window,['screen']
One of the advantages of the LG G6 screen is that we can enjoy more content at a glance,['screen']
This means that we can see better the notifications received or for example we have more visible lines on the screen on the same site or journalistic article which affects positively on the reading,['screen']
Our experience throughout this analysis of the LG G6 has been outstanding even when managing multitasking or moving two apps at once with the most interesting split screen mode,['screen']
For this it has 4 GB of RAM LPDDR4 that offer more at a cost of autonomy less than what we saw in the LG G5,['ram']
One of the difficult things to understand is that the new LG smartphone has a storage capacity of 32 GB that although can be easily extended via microSD are below the average of other high-end,['storage']
We return to talk about double rear camera a feature that begins to seem obligatory within the high range one of them with wide angle lens but in this case both sensors have 13 megapixels hence it is now much more difficult to talk about main and secondary camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
In the more technical plane the normal camera is still the main one since it is the most capable of the two having a greater aperture f 1,['camera']
In fact if we want to force the camera to take pictures in 16 9 we will have to settle for a resolution much smaller than 9,['camera']
The front camera of 5 megapixels offers generally remarkable results counting as a main advantage the possibility of becoming selfish with a wide-angle aperture that fits almost everyone,['camera']
At the most practical level throughout this review of the LG G6 we have fallen in love with the carousel function that activates a strip of images at one end of the screen as a preview which saves a lot of time by not having to open one Again the photo gallery taking advantage of the pixel increase with the new aspect ratio 18 9 of the screen,"['screen', 'screen']"
Those who use Instagram at all times will love the new mode 1 1 square format camera that fits perfectly with the images of this social network,['camera']
"By dividing the screen into two squares we can access the following modes In short, the LG G6 camera is one of the most complete and fun we have ever tried","['screen', 'camera']"
It may not reach the level of excellence of other competitors that offer a greater level of detail and even more spectacular results in both the night shots and the selfies made with the front camera with also interesting modes like the portrait of the iPhone 7 Plus,['camera']
The battery of the LG G6 has increased significantly compared to the previous generation to reach the 3,['battery']
300 milliamperes something that is not surprising since we have a slightly larger screen and above all because we do not have the functionality that provides a removable battery,"['screen', 'battery']"
During our tests with the unit we have received for the analysis of the LG G6 we have managed to reach the end of the day with a very intensive use in which we have conjugated several hours of screen on around five opening several games synchronizing several mail accounts and playing Multiple videos via YouTube and Netflix,['screen']
The South Korean manufacturer has left behind the idea of ​​the modules that did not finish curdling among the general public to bet on a screen that is not only enormous in size but incorporates the latest technology to enjoy a sensational multimedia experience,['screen']
The camera is another of the elements that play in favor of LG G6,['camera']
We are facing a smartphone recommended with significant improvements in tangential screen and camera design that is already available in the market at a very competitive price,"['screen', 'camera']"
The management of the battery can be improved through the various saving modes that incorporates the software layer and especially if we take advantage of the fast charging technology Quick Charge 3,['battery']
0 with which we managed to recover the battery 40 in 30 minutes and around 70 in an hour,['battery']
"In practice, however, the LG G6's camera is extremely versatile and allows the user to play with many formulas for unrepeatable images",['camera']
LG has made every effort to take advantage of both its sensors and its spectacular display,['display']
"However when talking about a camera, many more things come into play, being elementary image processing",['camera']
That new chip that comes mainly from the hand of improvements in connectivity level processor and graphics card was introduced earlier this year but it has taken longer than expected to reach the production lines the new Xperia XZ Premium from Sony will not be able to The sale at least until May,['processor']
In addition to the mentioned method of rescaling the screen we have a last important feature,['screen']
We can also choose between several themes to apply different styles to the icons with or without background carry up to five shortcuts to the bottom bar or modify the size of these icons to display more or less on the screen,"['display', 'screen']"
LG's efforts at software level in this G6 have focused on maximizing the benefits of the screen 18 9,['screen']
"In short, the screen of the LG G6 is a window into the future of what is to come in the universe of smartphones",['screen']
One of the most obvious is that being a longer screen can see more information both when browsing and open certain apps and social networks like Twitter or Facebook which is undoubtedly a huge advantage,['screen']
In recent years have been recorded content in Univisium format 2 1 Stranger Things or House of Cards are two good examples that would fit perfectly to the screen of the G6,['screen']
On the other hand the trend in web design is focused on more elongated websites that better fit the vertical display with the LG G6,['display']
To solve it LG allows the rescaling of the applications in a very simple way being able to choose how we want to visualize it if we choose the format of full screen 18 9 we run the risk that part of the original image disappears,['screen']
According to our tests the screen of LG G6 is simply spectacular in all the sections,['screen']
In contrast the whole front and the glass of the double rear camera are protected by a glass sheet Corning Gorilla Glass 3 launched to the market in 2013 that in principle is a little thicker and somewhat less resistant than the one that we find in the other side Of the telephone issue of costs It is not advisable to mess with him in the pool but at least we assure that he will survive to misunderstandings or small accidents,['camera']
The G6 is a great phone from LG  one that pushes the brand back to the forefront of the smartphone pile in terms of design and screen,['screen']
 However  lower spec performance and not upgrading the camera in a meaningful way while still charging a huge premium make this a tough sell,['camera']
  The G6 is a much more conservative design than its predecessor  taking the form of a sealed unit that drops the removable battery  replacing it with a larger capacity power pack and waterproof shell,['battery']
 The screen is  really  the only place where innovation is still present on the G6  with the longer 18 9 display giving more screen real estate to play with  and introducing some clever little changes to the user interface to exploit the extra pixels,"['screen', 'display', 'screen']"
 It s got a lower spec in some areas  has prioritised things like design over an improved camera,['camera']
  The rear of the phone is smooth  with no protruding camera bump   we ll get onto the snapper in a moment  but LG told us it chose slimmer sensors rather than more advanced camera tech to make the design of the phone sleeker,"['camera', 'camera']"
  It s a gamble  but last year s camera was fine  and LG can probably just get away without another change,['camera']
  Some LG phone lovers will be distraught  however  to find that the battery is now sealed into the handset   LG has finally given up on the removable power pack in order to put in a more powerful and slimmer juice unit,['battery']
 The need for removable power packs is almost dead thanks to the proliferation of portable battery chargers  but its V series phones  such as the LG V20 launched last year  keeps the option for now,['battery']
 MicroSD support still exists  with the up to 2TB expansion option thrust into the SIM tray  and complementing the 32GB of onboard storage  however  it s really annoying that you can t adopt the storage from the memory card and use it as internal memory like other phones allow you to do,"['storage', 'storage', 'memory', 'memory']"
 The 18 9 screen   which is branded  FullVision   is created by LG s own screen division  LG Display,"['screen', 'screen', 'display']"
  While it lacks the colorful pop of the Samsung Galaxy S7  for instance  with its Super AMOLED screen  there s a vivacity that s well complemented by the longer display,"['screen', 'display']"
  The screen on the LG G6 is impressive  but as suspected the larger dimensions are  largely  not much use in apps,['screen']
 What s surprising is some games work better in the larger format   when you open some titles you re presented with a little logo in the top right hand side of the screen that lets you extend the contents a little further  and gaming seems to deal with this flawlessly,['screen']
  The Always On Display is still a good move   it s something that s both useful and visually appealing on this phone,['display']
 However  when you re in the dark it s clear to see that the LED lights at the bottom of the screen are illuminating it  with a slight flare protruding up the display,"['screen', 'display']"
  LG is still using the pervasive display on the lock screen  known as the Always On Display on Samsung phones   so you can see the time without needing to turn on the phone,"['display', 'screen', 'display']"
  Both South Korean brands claim the same battery life reduction for using this feature  but surely it would be more efficient on an OLED panel,['battery']
  And then we get into the awkward mention of the Samsung Galaxy S8   that s a phone which is all screen and doesn t cost that much more,['screen']
  Not to say that LG hasn t pulled off a nice looking device with an attractive screen,['screen']
 The new FullVision 18 9 display has given LG a few more pixels to work with  and now the display is essentially two squares stacked on top of one another,"['display', 'display']"
  This means  for example  that in the contacts menu the contact image is larger  more settings are visible and you ll be able to see more Facebook on the screen without the need for scrolling through,['screen']
 You can also rotate the phone and either have two apps running in multi window or  for certain apps  have two different functions on the screen at once,['screen']
 LG s certainly made good use of the extra screen space it s managed to eke out   things like the weather app have been well thought through and look visually appealing,['screen']
  The  two square  interface isn t as useful as expected  as it s only in the square camera that you ll really notice it,['camera']
 The icons on the home screen  which still comes without an app drawer by default  are tidied up too  with the rounded look applied throughout,['screen']
   The ability to extend the screen out is nice  but the full screen extension isn t as easy as on the Galaxy S8   you need to pull down the notifications shade and it ll pop up,"['screen', 'screen']"
  Ultimately  the longer screen hasn t really been used in a way that makes a massive difference here  but everything does feel a bit more immersive,['screen']
 The LG G6 camera is upgraded in a way  but also remains very similar to last year s in others,['camera']
 The same normal and wide angle camera lenses are back  but they re now both 13MP,['camera']
 The new 18 9 screen size has given LG a chance to have two Instagram friendly squares on the screen at once  and it s used them pretty well,"['screen', 'screen']"
   Our favorite is the large preview  where you can take pictures on one side and have the full screen previews alongside  which you can scroll through while still snapping,['screen']
 Alternatively  there s an option to use the same size camera viewfinder as found on the G5  with the extra pixels used to show a strip of recently taken photos  which again makes it easy to multitask using the camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
  The LG G6 is an advanced phone with a strong camera  even if it s not the best out   there are plenty of new features to enjoy  although they re rather hard to find  the square mode picture options are hidden under myriad menus  or a separate app on another home screen ,"['camera', 'screen']"
   LG will struggle to overcome the negative press of not really improving the camera from last year  but with new square features and decent performance  users probably won t mind too much,['camera']
 The improvement of the battery from 2 800mAh to 3 300mAh should bring cheers from anyone who wants a phone with a long battery life   LG has historically been excellent at optimizing battery  so packing in more power is always going to be a welcome move,"['battery', 'battery', 'battery']"
 The sleek metal and glass fusion is attractive  and to anyone using the iPhone 7 Plus  the ratio of screen to body will be staggering,['screen']
 The LG G6 is a phone for those that like the look of the Samsung Galaxy S8 with its bezel less  ish  screen  and don t want to pay quite as much,['screen']
  However  if you re an LG fan and like what s on offer here  you ll appreciate the longer interface and want to play with the dual window camera,['camera']
 This is a good camera for social cuts  and if you put the work in you can take some fun snaps,['camera']
  The LG G6 isn t the only flagship worth your attention  or even the only all screen one,['screen']
 There s nothing wrong with this phone  and you ll enjoy the ergonomic way it s put together and the sheer amount of screen on offer,['screen']
  The camera and general interface are quick to work and snappy to use  and while the battery life isn t great  in the US particularly you re not short of options to charge it,"['camera', 'battery']"
 so how do we know that the company will work with app developers to improve their wares for its longer screen format   LG might have signed a death warrant on the success of the G6 for one reason  the price,['screen']
 The screen is good  but bested by Samsung,['screen']
 The Pixel has a better camera,['camera']
  That doesn t mean the G6 isn t innovative   the screen looks great and there s raw power  from the camera to the battery to the general snappiness of the handset  rippling through this phone,"['screen', 'camera', 'battery']"
  The larger display has been well used for the native apps  and thankfully worries about black bars appearing around the apps are unfounded,['display']
 You ll need to work with them a little bit to make certain apps run in full screen  but ultimately the experience is sound and isn t ruined by the new ratio,['screen']
  There aren t many other new battery optimizations from LG here  but then again it probably didn t need them   with the more powerful and longer lasting power pack on show users should be able to eke out longer between charges than ever before,['battery']
  LG has put some smarts into the charging though  with the phone able to read the age and temperature of the battery to make sure the right amount of current goes into the power pack,['battery']
  In terms of day to day use  the LG G6 is just  well  fine when it comes to battery performance,['battery']
  In our battery testing  we ran a 90 minute Full HD video with the brightness cranked up to the maximum  and the phone dropped 14  of its power in that time  which isn t the best we ve seen  but it s better than average,['battery']
  The iPhone 7 for comparison dropped 23  in this test  while the Lenovo P2   which has a big 5 100mAh battery   dropped just 8 ,['battery']
  The LG G6 rarely ran out of battery  and when it was ensconced in a pocket the power drain was relatively minimal  but overall when in use the drop in battery life for the day was a little more than we d have liked,"['battery', 'battery']"
  In terms of day to day use  the LG G6 is just  well  fine when it comes to battery performance,['battery']

  The LG G6 rarely ran out of battery  and when it was ensconced in a pocket the power drain was relatively minimal  but overall when in use the drop in battery life for the day was a little more than we d have liked,"['battery', 'battery']"
  This is where the inclusion of the Snapdragon 821 processor is going to have an effect too  according to LG  as its engineers have worked with the chipset for longer and have managed to extract more performance out of it  which leads to longer lasting and less hot handsets,['processor']
 If you re a fan of taking pics of lots of people  then this is a great camera,['camera']
 The front features Gorilla Glass 3 protection  as does the camera lens cover on the rear   while the back cover is made from Gorilla Glass 5,['camera']
 Unlike previous G series flagships  the LG G6 features a unibody design  which unfortunately means the company had to forego the removable battery this time around,['battery']
 The standout feature on the LG G6 is the new 18 9 2 1 aspect ratio screen  which  coupled with some excellent design choices  means LG has managed to fit a 5,['screen']
7 inch display in a body that s not much larger than a regular 5,['display']
 You ll also find rounded corners for both the display and the outer frame and the result is a one handed experience that s arguably the best of any 5,['display']
 LG says the decision to make the display and the frame rounded makes the screen more durable against corner impacts versus a traditional screen with regular corners,"['display', 'screen', 'screen']"
 The display is an LCD instead of an OLED panel  but it s a very good looking display to say the least  and by far the best screen we ve ever seen on an LG phone,"['display', 'display', 'screen']"
 Rather curiously  the default out of the box wallpaper  which was developed in partnership with Pantone  doesn t do the display much justice  but switching it out to one of the others shows off the display in all its glory,"['display', 'display']"
 Without doubt  the LG G6 s display is fantastic and hopefully a sign of things to come for future smartphone displays,['display']
 With the G6 s rounded corners  slim bezels and 18 9 aspect ratio  we finally have a handset that has a large screen without the big footprint we ve been accustomed to,['screen']
 Ahead of the launch of the LG G6  we heard rumors that LG would opt for last year s Snapdragon 821 processor rather than the new Snapdragon 835  mainly as the latter would require the launch to be delayed several months,['processor']
 As a result  the LG G6 comes equipped with the Snapdragon 821 processor alongside 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU  which is the same package found in the OnePlus 3T and Google s Pixel XL  the former being the handset we crowned the best smartphone of 2016  Some people may be disappointed that the LG G6 isn t powered by the Snapdragon 835  but we ve really had no issues with performance  the handset handles everything you can throw at it,"['processor', 'ram']"
 The LG G6 comes equipped with 32GB of storage in most markets  which is expandable by up to 2TB using a microSD card slot,['storage']
 For users in the US  there s no Quad DAC or model with more than 32GB of storage  but there is wireless charging  the G6 supports both WPC and PMA wireless charging standards,['storage']
 The switch to a metal glass unibody design means the LG G6 has a non removable 3 300mAh battery  which isn t the largest we ve seen on a smartphone but certainly delivers respectable battery life,"['battery', 'battery']"
 One of the perceived benefits of the Snapdragon 835 processor is an apparent boost in battery life of up to 20 percent  but this has yet to be proven,"['processor', 'battery']"
 LG s decision to go with the tried and tested Snapdragon 821 certainly seems to have paid off with the battery proving to be reliable and capable of lasting even the heaviest of usage,['battery']
 Overall  battery enthusiasts might be disappointed at the lack of a removable battery in the LG G6 but the hefty boost in capacity  coupled with software enhancements and a reliable processing package certainly delivers flagship worthy battery life,"['battery', 'battery', 'battery']"
 The LG G6 camera has also had a little upgrade this year but it s not quite what you may have expected  rather than the customary boost in megapixels or pixel size  LG has opted to reduce the regular camera from 16MP to 13MP and boost the wide angle camera to the same 13MP resolution,"['camera', 'camera', 'camera']"
 Doing so has meant they can also remove the camera bump  resulting in a camera that s flush with the rest of the body,"['camera', 'camera']"
 Parity between the two cameras is arguably my favorite thing about the LG G6 camera  the LG G5 and the V20 both have a large disparity between the two sensors  with the regular sensor capturing 16MP images while the wide angle shoots at 8MP,['camera']
 As a result  there s a noticeable difference in the quality of images captured by both sensors and as LG correctly identified  it made the wide angle camera the  secondary  camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The camera app is mostly the same as previous years but thanks to the 18 9 screen  you have the addition of one of my favorite LG G6 features   the camera carousel,"['camera', 'screen', 'camera']"
 The camera carousel is one of the best uses of the wider screen and shows just how useful 18 9 can be,"['camera', 'screen']"
 Elsewhere around the camera interface  you get the standard button controls at the top to switch between the two lenses that we ve come to expect from LG s dual cameras,['camera']
 With parity between the two cameras  you can also zoom and change lenses by pinching the display,['display']
 The camera tweaks don t stop there as LG has also added a new square camera that s perfect for Instagram and comes with a few different modes built into it,"['camera', 'camera']"
 One allows you to snap a photo and immediately see a preview of it on the bottom half of the screen while another lets you take multiple photos or short clips that the camera will stitch together automatically,"['screen', 'camera']"
 For those who like putting four photos together in a collage  you can take four different photos in the grid shot mode and the camera will do all the heavy lifting,['camera']
 Once you dig into guide shot however  you see that you can also take multiple shots and turn them into a GIF at the press of a button  it s a hidden feature that only shows up once you take multiple shots in guide shot mode  but it s by far my favorite feature of the square camera,['camera']
 Without doubt  the LG G6 camera is a lot of fun to use  especially thanks to the wide angle lens which can really take some breathtaking shots,['camera']
 On the front  you ve got a 5MP camera which has a wide 100 degree field of view and you can swap between narrow and wide angles  which makes it perfect for group shots,['camera']
 This isn t overly surprising given it s the front  facing camera  but something to keep in mind nonetheless,['camera']
 Overall  the LG G6 camera is a joy to use  and  given the right conditions  it can take truly breathtaking photos,['camera']
 Whether it s the square camera fun  the two angles or the manual video controls  there s a lot to like about the LG G6 camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The new icons are designed to complement the rounded corners of the display,['display']
 Thankfully  LG provides an option in the home screen settings to display the icons without the backgrounds,"['screen', 'display']"
 Without doubt  the display is fantastic but as mentioned  the default  6  wallpaper doesn t really show it off,['display']
 As part of its push towards the 18 9 screen  LG has also updated its app to show off what s possible with the new aspect ratio,['screen']
 LG has worked hard to optimize the software for the smoothest experience  there s very little bloat on our unlocked units and LG s own apps and wallpapers are fantastic at showing off the new 18 9 aspect ratio on the screen,['screen']
 It performs well  has an excellent camera  flagship worthy battery life and features that people want  such as wireless charging and water resistance,"['camera', 'battery']"
 The new 18 9 screen pushes the envelope of smartphone functionality and combined with the super slim bezels  LG has proven that a big display doesn t have to mean a big phone,"['screen', 'display']"
    Press and hold the on screen home key and you ll no longer get Google Now as in previous years  instead  the LG G6 is the first non Pixel Android phone to run Google s Assistant out of the box and provides some very welcome competition for Google s flagship Pixel XL,['screen']
 The app icons have been updated to square icons with rounded corners for a much more uniform look   and the additional benefit of having square icons on a perfectly square half of the display   while pop up menus within applications also have rounded corners,['display']
  For those wondering  we re both capable of achieving 5 hours  worth of screen on time off a single charge and that s without really trying to hit those numbers,['screen']
 With some tweaks to usage  it would certainly be feasible to expect six or even seven hours of screen of time,['screen']
  How does the G6 stack up to our Android Authority battery tests  How does it compare to the competition  In our quick battery test  which tests Wi Fi browsing  video playback and gaming for 90 minutes and extrapolates the results to simulate a full day s usage  the LG G6 scored a very respectable 7 hours and 51 minutes,"['battery', 'battery']"
  Our next test looks at Wi Fi browsing with each phone charged to full  the display set to 200 nits brightness and the handset placed a meter from the router with no app data syncing,['display']
 Gaming is traditionally a sure fire way to drain your battery rather quickly so in this test  we set a game to repeat its demo mode with the rest of the testing conditions the same,['battery']
  During Lanh s testing  he found that even with a heavy usage day   such as using the camera lot with a few hours of gaming   the phone still has 20 to 25 percent battery life left at the end of the day,"['camera', 'battery']"
 Personally  I ve been very impressed by the battery life,['battery']
 Even on days with heavy usage  I ve not had to top the battery up at all,['battery']
 The global version has the features listed above but in certain Asian markets  the base model has 64GB storage while other Asian models have the Quad DAC found in the LG V20,['storage']
  Overall  there s a lot to like about the LG G6 display,['display']
 It may not be the most accurate screen  nor an AMOLED panel  but LG has done more than enough to convince us that 18 9 is the future of smartphone screens and not just a gimmick,['screen']
  Like most flagships  there s also an always on display which does the job and shows you notifications without first making you turn the screen on,"['display', 'screen']"
 The company has also included a new brighter screen option for the always on display  but Lanh and I both agree   we re not entirely sure what this feature accomplishes,"['screen', 'display']"
 It doesn t appear to make the always on display any brighter,['display']
  Putting it through our testing  we found the display to have a max manual brightness of 556 nits  which is boosted to a very respectable 663 nits when auto brightness is engaged under direct light,['display']
 Its color temperature of 8281 Kelvin is rather on the cool side resulting in a blue ish tinge to the whites   which is common to all LCD panels   but this isn t immediately noticeable and the display certainly looks fantastic,['display']
  Spending time with the LG G6 s display does raise a larger issue around the aspect ratio  especially if it s to become the standard for phones going forward,['display']
7 inch display,['display']
 If you split the screen in half  you essentially get two perfectly symmetrical squares stacked on top of each other,['screen']
 In landscape mode  for instance  the display splits up into two squares side by side  this arrangement makes multitasking a bit easier as you re able to see more of each app,['display']
  Personally  I ll happily take the enhanced durability over a removable battery,['battery']
7 inch screen with a unique 18 9 aspect ratio,['screen']
 With other phones expected to also offer the same aspect ratio display later this year  the G6 could prove to be a forward thinking phone rather than yet another one hit wonder from LG,['display']
  LG G6 pricing and availability  what we know so far LG G6 officially announced  everything you need to know Is a unique display and solid    if muted   package enough to make the LG G6 a must buy  With a package that s mostly identical to the LG V20  should you buy a G series or a V series  Does LG s decision to ditch the gimmicks and focus on a solid experience pay off  Find out  in our full LG G6 review,['display']
 Literally because its display doesn t have right angles  it s soft arcs instead,['display']
 And figuratively because the G6 doesn t come with the screaming hardware on the market  but makes do with a few months old chipset and  just  4GB of RAM,['ram']
  Another eyebrow raiser is the choice of the Sony IMX258 camera sensor  the imager of choice for a few dozen smartphones  going as far as two years back,['camera']
  It s also still the same concept   a crazy ultra wide angle camera accompanies the regular one,['camera']
 But best of all   that display,['display']
 That s what LG s surveys showed too  so its designers went out and stretched the screen to cover most of the device s front   the 5,['screen']
7 inch 18 9 aspect panel fits in the same body footprint as the G5 s  admittedly  the G5 is not a screen to body ratio contest winner  but still ,['screen']
7 inch display,['display']
5 inch display  like the one on the Galaxy S7 edge   but also the 5,['display']
7 inch display in a smaller body than the 5,['display']
 he G5 had a removable chin that gave access to the user replaceable battery and could be swapped out for one of a few modules called Friends,['battery']
  The G5 had a metal back  which however was covered by plastic or primer  whatever you like to call it  and it also had an unsightly camera hump on the rear  which LG tried to turn into a design accent,['camera']
  A lot of that novelty comes from the display,['display']
 It goes something like this   1   Ooh  nice  slim bezels   and then  2   No way  the corners are rounded   to finally   3   Hmm  that s one tall screen   And that s before you even pick the phone up,['screen']
 Moving on to the curved screen corners,['screen']
 You see  with such a slim frame around the display  the precious LCD is perilously close to the physical corners of the phone,['display']
 All of this is  of course  applicable to every other phone  it s just that on the G6 the issue is made worse by the close proximity of the display to the physical extremities,['display']
  And then we get to the fact that the display is taller than the conventional 16 9 aspect ratio,['display']
 As the story goes  LG asked a bunch of people how they feel about display size and everyone replied they want more  but generally no one was thrilled about the extra bulk the bigger screen brings,"['display', 'screen']"
 So LG went ahead and stretched the display taller  and made it so that would cover almost the entire front of the phone   with that chin provision  of course,['display']
7 inch display in 18 9 ratio is actually smaller in area than a 5,['display']
7 inch display in 16 9 ratio   83,['display']
 In fact  the LG G6 total screen area equals that of a conventional 5,['screen']
5 inch 16 9 screen,['screen']
7 inch 16 9 screen would be 71,['screen']
 So the G6 s approach to offer the most display in the easiest to handle package makes perfect sense,['display']
 There s a cutout for the camera duo  but the setup now sits flush with the cover as opposed to the G5 s camera bulge,"['camera', 'camera']"
 One of the LG G6 s most distinctive features  its 18 9 aspect Full Vision display is a true beauty,['display']
5 inch conventional 16 9 display  and is  in fact  as wide as a 5,['display']
2 inch 16 9 screen  only taller,['screen']
 The G5 before it wasn t too shabby either with its high 1800s  but man  was that display dim,['display']
 One of the best LCDs in this respect  the G6 s display is on par with the iPhone 7 Plus  but the Xperia XZ and LG s own V20 are still somewhat superior,['display']
 So while it s great that the display supports both standards  the feature is not exactly a gamechanger,['display']
  There s of course Wi Fi ac with Wi Fi direct and DLNA  and wireless screen sharing is supported to both Miracast and Chromecast devices,['screen']
 The LG G6 is powered by a 3 300mAh battery   a significant upgrade over last year s G5 and its 2 800mAh,['battery']
 The G6 has a larger display  you ll counter  but the battery capacity has been upped by 18  while screen area is just 8  more now,"['display', 'battery', 'screen']"
 In fact  the G6 packs more juice than the V20  3 000mAh   which has a larger display to light up   5,['display']
7  in 18 9  plus the V20 has that ticker screen on top,['screen']
 The G6 s battery  however  is sealed in  unlike both the G5 and the V20,['battery']
 Anyway  all this is to preface that we expected better battery life from the G6 than what we got out of the G5 and V20  neither of which were particularly impressive in this respect,['battery']
  Dialing in those numbers in our formula produces a 72h overall Endurance rating with the always on display turned off,['display']
 However  and we ve always tried to point that out  the effect of the always on display consumption can vary wildly depending on usage   it s one thing if the phone is held in your pocket  where it will eventually turn off the AOD on its own   it s completely different if it stays on the table in front of you and the ambient lighting is strong enough that it needs to crank up the brightness higher,['display']
 That  as it turns out  is also a setting in the always on display menu   you can actually tell the phone to keep the always on feature brighter unlike with the G5,['display']
 Whatever you decide on that  the overall effect of the AOD on your battery life is probably not that big of an issue as it may appear so just deal with it and enjoy the extra functionality,['battery']
 LG has also optimized its charging algorithms to fine tune the charging process depending on the battery s age and current temperature thus improving the battery s long term life,"['battery', 'battery']"
 LG calls it Full screen UX to further emphasize the uniqueness of the display,"['screen', 'display']"
 While the V20 phablet has a secondary display to show the time and notifications  the G6 relies on an always on display to do the same,"['display', 'display']"
 You can have one of three designs for the always on display and we d gladly sacrifice the signature for a date,['display']
 You get two shortcuts in the bottom corners by default   to the dialer and the camera,['camera']
 Native split screen multitasking has arrived with Nougat,['screen']
  Many  but not all  apps can work in split screen mode,['screen']
  Note  from the Developers options  you can force Android to enable split screen multitasking for all apps,['screen']
  In split screen view  the Home button shows your homescreen but does not dismiss the apps   the app switcher button shows the split screen icon and double tapping it brings back the two,"['screen', 'screen']"
 This is great since normally you can only pick apps from the app switcher rolodex for split screen use  but in this state  any app you launch from the homescreen goes straight into split screen mode,"['screen', 'screen']"
 The Memories screen takes photos and videos and creates a short video out of them  the content is grouped by time and location ,['screen']
 Also available as a separate app icon on the homescreen  Square Camera   it s LG trying to come up with use cases for the 2 1 display,"['camera', 'display']"
 Square Camera has modes of its own  the usefulness ranges from,['camera']
 Snapshot leaves half the screen as a viewfinder  for taking square photos  obviously  while the other half gives you a preview  technically  post view  of the shot as soon as you take it,['screen']
 It works on both the normal and wide camera too,['camera']
 But hey  we d take the G6 s chamfered display corners any day if they make the phone that extra bit more likely to live through a drop out of our clumsy hands,['display']
 Because that display is one true gem  and we d like to keep it crack free and in working order,['display']
 Battery life is a marked improvement compared to both the G5 and V20  and the G6 achieves a 72h Endurance rating,['battery']
 The selfie camera appears to be the same one from the V20   wide and normal modes from the same sensor  not great but decent detail,['camera']
 First up  if you insist on the ultra wide angle camera  there s no one else other than than LG that offers that,['camera']
 Neither matches the G6 in battery life  but on both you can just swap in a freshly charged battery unlike the G6,"['battery', 'battery']"
 If you feel like the ticker display of the V20 can be useful  well then   V20,['display']
 The V20 also has more actual display area than the G6 in a more widely used 16 9 format,['display']
 The S7 edge has longer battery life going for it  as well as a lower price   lower by up to 200 ,['battery']
 Those 4 3 photos are otherwise quite good  even if they only fill two thirds of the screen,['screen']
 It s very likely the S835 will be slightly easier on the battery and a little more powerful  but the S821 isn t remotely a dealbreaker,['battery']
 We ve uploaded a bunch of them up on our server  a set of three from the normal camera  2160p  1080p 30fps  and 1080p 60fps   and a matching trio from the wide angle one  2160p  1080p 30fps  and 1080p 60fps ,['camera']
    Grid shot is like a camera booth   it creates a 2x2 photo collage,['camera']
 Again  half the screen is the viewfinder  while the other half is the collage in the making,['screen']
 The normal camera now sees a 71  field of view  as opposed to 75  before  while the ultra wide angle s FOV has been reduced from 135  to 125    still very much ultra wide,['camera']
 The wide camera is fixed focus only  unlike the normal one that does actually use the phase detection agents on the IMX258,['camera']
  The camera app of the G6 has seen some changes as well  to make better use of the tall display,"['camera', 'display']"
 Or  rather  wide display  when you hold it in landscape,['display']
 The extra screen estate on the side is used as a film strip  showing you recently taken shots,['screen']
 A most welcome addition in the LG camera app is the exposure compensation slider that shows up on the right when you tap somewhere to focus   a handy tool that s been missing so far,['camera']
 On the back of the device one can find the dual camera setup with an LED flash  along with the fingerprint sensor placed slightly below them,['camera']
 Also worth noting is the fact that the camera setup is completely flush with the back panel  which is completely flat as a result,['camera']
 The front of the device is almost exclusively dominated by its screen  with minimal screen bezels and no physical buttons present,"['screen', 'screen']"
 Above it sit the front camera  sensors  and earpiece  while the space below is empty  save for the LG logo,['camera']
 Also  while LG has put considerable effort into minimizing screen cracking  it doesn t appear to have given as much attention to the back panel  which could easily turn out to be prone to breaking  despite being made out of Gorilla Glass 5,['screen']
  The display supports the Dolby Vision HDR technology  which lets it display up to 64 billion colors  provided you have access to a video in a compatible format,"['display', 'display']"
 Bezels are thankfully very thin  though the effect is slightly diminished by the unusual screen edge design,['screen']
 As a result  the device comes equipped with a quad core processor and 4 GB of RAM  which should be more than enough for most people  but may displease some of the power users out there,"['processor', 'ram']"
 The battery has a 3300 mAh capacity  which should be enough to last a day or so  but is unfortunately non removable,['battery']
 In a direct jab at Samsung and the Note 7 fiasco  LG also flaunts the extensive testing of the device s battery  claiming it s much more reliable,['battery']
 A big problem for some could be the inclusion of only 32 GB of internal storage  64 GB in some Asian countries ,['storage']
 While the phone does include an SD card slot  external storage is still a tad slower than built in one,['storage']
 This problem has been somewhat rectified by the option to format an SD card as internal memory  which was introduced in Android Marshmallow  but it s still a clunky and imperfect solution,['memory']
 While not many people need that much storage  it could still prove problematic for those who do  so keep that in mind,['storage']
 Another recent trend we ve noticed in high end phones has been the inclusion of dual camera setups,['camera']
 The rear camera also supports the HDR10 format  letting users take photos with a much larger dynamic range,['camera']
 The bundled camera app takes advantage of the device s 2 1 screen  offering a number of special shooting modes  called Snap shot  Match shot  Grid shot  and Guide shot,"['camera', 'screen']"
 All of them use square photos  but with different results  Snap shot displays the last photo next to the one being taken right now  Match shot stitches two photos  one on top of the other  Grid shot makes a 2x2 square collage  and Guide shot overlaps a portion of an image over the camera preview,['camera']
 And not in the sort of standard  slightly faster than last year  and with a marginally better camera  way that ends up defining so many popular handsets,['camera']
 With the fresh crop of 2017 flagships just beginning to land  we re seeing the arrival of a new direction for one of the most familiar  fundamental components of a smartphone s hardware makeup  the display,['display']
  With the LG G6  the manufacturer invites us into the new world of the 18 9 screen,['screen']
 For years now  the standard 16 9 display has dominated smartphone sales   even Apple  reluctantly  joined the party   but this year we re finally seeing the companies that make our favorite phones start trying something new,['display']
  LG G6 Review LG G6 Review This new extra wide  or extra tall  shape for the G6 s screen is a big part of what makes this phone so interesting  but that s far from the only design decision worth paying attention to,['screen']
 We ve got a sleek new look with no appreciably camera bump  a premium  glass encased metal body that trades its removable battery for water resistance  and built in wireless charging  for some of you ,"['camera', 'battery']"
  Add to that things like a no compromise  full resolution wide angle camera  and Google s latest software and services  and we ve got what looks  on paper  at least  like one of the most compelling new smartphones to land so far this year,['camera']
 We re going to pivot back around to LG s crazy wide screen display in just a moment  taking a closer look at what it offers  and why   but it s impossible to talk about the design of the G6 without putting the phone s screen front and center,"['screen', 'display', 'screen']"
 While this isn t a phone that strives to offer a stunning bezelless or otherwise over the edge display  it s still one that s particularly eye catching if only because of the spectacular job that screen does at filling the phone s face,"['display', 'screen']"
 LG quotes an 80 percent screen to body ratio  and while that s not quite the highest we ve ever seen  thanks to entries from companies like Xiaomi   it still goes a very long way towards making it feel like you re not so much holding a phone with a screen on it  but that you re just holding a screen,"['screen', 'screen', 'screen']"
 Little details like how the curves at the corners of the display mirror the curves of the phone itself really help sell that that illusion,['display']
 LG s flagship phones have played around with screen sizes for years  usually bouncing around the low to mid 5 inch space,['screen']
7 inch LCD screen with a 2K class  1440 x 2880  resolution  rounded off corners  and featuring an extra wide 18 9 aspect ratio,['screen']
  We could spend this entire review just talking about the unusual new display LG chose to use on the G6   what s changed  why that matters  and how it all ultimately impacts how you ll use the phone   but because there s a lot more to this smartphone that just its screen  we re going to try and show some restraint,"['display', 'screen']"
 This 18 9 aspect is arguably more properly called 2 1   that is  the screen s exactly twice as tall as it is wide,['screen']
 Your typical 16 9 phone screen  by comparison  is a bit too short to have the same said about it,['screen']
 And while it s easy to associate such bars with a feeling of  I m watching this content on the wrong screen   they can actually work the G6,['screen']
 And the screen s also wide enough that you can call up your virtual on screen Android buttons without them appearing on top of  and blocking  your video,"['screen', 'screen']"
  The situation with apps is a little tricky  as few are explicitly designed to be used on a screen like this,['screen']
 Thankfully  LG includes an easy to use settings panel that lets you dictate how apps are scaled to the screen,['screen']
 Really  though  we didn t run into many issues with how apps use the screen   though it s very nice to know that LG has gotten ahead of the potential problem  all the same,['screen']
 See  this isn t just some weird software trick to give the G6 s screen a  more  interesting look,['screen']
 And you can t turn those curved corners back on in software  the screen really is clipped,['screen']
 By avoiding hard right angles  LG is trying to mitigate screen damage caused by drops and other impacts,['screen']
 While the shock wave from such incidents has a bad habit of traveling along the screen  being concentrated in right angle corners  and causing breakage  this new design supposedly lessens that risk,['screen']
  While we re quickly finding ourselves won over by the eccentricities of the LG G6 s display  it s still not a screen without its issues,"['display', 'screen']"
 Though our measurements confirm that the display is decently bright  it s still a phone that s dimmer than a number of its peers  and our subjective experience often felt like the handset was on the dimmer side when actually using the G6  especially outdoors,['display']
   Color reproduction in general also isn t superb  and while it s better than many phones  there s a touch of AMOLED style  which this LCD panel very much is not  over saturation at the top of the screen s output range,['screen']
 Don t dig having all your apps cluttering the home screen  Toggle back on a classic app drawer,['screen']
  The big questions most users are going to have about the interface aren t these sorts of general Android concerns  though  what s the deal with this new screen shape  and how does it impact usability   Well  we ve touched on some of issues already when covering the display  talking about the phone s software controls for changing app scaling and their aspect ratios in order to keep things functional and natural looking on the G6 s 18 9 screen,"['screen', 'display', 'screen']"
 That s one big part of the equation  but we also see how existing Android functionality takes full advantage of this new screen geometry,['screen']
 Take multi window for instance  while split screen on phones always ran the risk of feeling more than a bit cramped  the shape of the G6 s display helps two apps exist side by side in just a bit more comfort,"['screen', 'display']"
 We re going to talk about the phone s camera  and its software  in depth in just a moment  but that s a great example of an app evolving for this new 18 9 world,['camera']
 There  LG finds room to squeeze a camera roll of recently shot thumbnails up against the side of the screen  while still having more than enough space for camera controls and your live viewfinder,"['camera', 'screen', 'camera']"
  All that said  the screen on this phone is tall  and there s a good chance you won t be able to reach it all at once in one handed operation,['screen']
 Admittedly  the screen isn t so wide as to cause many problems  but the height can be an issue  you may end up shifting the G6 around in your hand as you go from interacting with Android navigation buttons to pulling down your notification shade,['screen']
  The company offers legitimate sounding rationales for its choice of processor  talking about the lengthy development pipeline,['processor']
  Using the phone  everything feels appropriately smooth  whether stretching an app to fill the G6 s extra tall screen  or running a pair of them side by side,['screen']
  LG gives the G6 the expected 4GB of RAM  but we re a little sad to see it stick with just 32GB storage  at least for the US model ,"['ram', 'storage']"
   At least there s micro SD expansion  and like the G5  LG s back with another unusual side by side tray for the memory card and SIM,['memory']
  As you should be able to tell from that breakdown of G6 camera hardware  LG has made a real commitment to making this phone a serious contender when it comes to smartphone based photography,['camera']
 With as oddly shaped a screen as the G6 has  potential buyers are bound to start asking   where can I get some video content that matches the dimensions of my screen   And while there s a growing list of 18 9 productions available through streaming services  sometimes the best answer really is  just make it yourself,"['screen', 'screen']"
 We just talked about shooting your own 18 9 video  but you ve also got streaming options  and if you subscribe to a service like Netflix  you ll find series such as Stranger Things or House of Cards all ready to be viewed full screen  with no black bars to be found,['screen']
 VLC ended up working quite nicely  letting us scale our video to fit the G6 s screen as we chose,['screen']
 Four mean that you re wasting screen real estate,['screen']
 We re not trying to throw around blame here  but it s still worth pointing out a common use case where the G6 s screen fitting tools let users down,['screen']
 The decision to launch the G6 without a removable battery is going to be a controversial one  especially with LG as one of the last hold outs offering such a feature on its flagship phones,['battery']
 But all is not lost  as while the G6 s battery is baked in  it s also much larger than the 2 800mAh component from the G5  now topping out at a very phablet level 3 300mAh,['battery']
7 inch phones  LG s ability to squeeze that much screen real estate onto this small a handset is nothing short of impressive,['screen']
 We can t help but wonder what performance and battery life would look like if LG only had some slightly different priorities going in to making the G6  and there s going to be a not unexpected period of adjustment as content creators adapt to this new 18 9 era,['battery']
 Maybe the new screen shape won t be nearly as controversial as us hardware nerds make it out to be  and the app and media issues will largely pass users by unnoticed,['screen']
 But even if they re not thinking about pillarboxing or aspect ratios  they re absolutely going to pay attention to the way the G6 feels like the entire thing is one big screen,['screen']
  Battery life on the G6 is a bit of a double edged sword,['battery']
 On one hand  standby times can be really  really good  and if you re not spending a lot of time actually interacting with the G6  you probably won t have a problem picking up the phone at any moment and finding plenty of battery capacity remaining  even several days after a charge,['battery']
  But actually use the G6 for any appreciable period and you re going to see battery life start dropping   and sometimes  fast,['battery']
 Our tests saw the phone managing just minutes over six hours of screen on time before running dry,['screen']
 It s not necessarily a deal breaker  like if we were looking at five hours of screen on time   but there s a real chance that the G6 won t quite have enough juice to address your power user needs,['screen']
 Between that and the wireless charging support  it gets a little easier to give the G6 some leeway with its battery life issues   but still  another hour of raw endurance would go a long way towards making us feel better about the whole situation,['battery']
 We found ourselves wishing we could pair this big  beautiful screen with some stereo sound  but sadly LG doesn t use the phone s earpiece as a second speaker,['screen']
 Even after firing up Netflix  and identifying and tracking down some 18 9 video  it still wasn t quite filling the screen,['screen']
 Those concessions aren t too  too bad  and while we absolutely love having 18 9 filming options at all  it would have been nice to get one that can record at the full resolution of the phone s screen,['screen']
 One big plus is the ability to toggle between zoom and wide cameras while you re right in the middle of filming  and while there can be a very brief period where the camera has to recompute its exposure levels  it s still impressively seamless,['camera']
   Night shots also look quite nice  but here in particular we start to notice the differences between the two cameras  with both OIS and a larger aperture  the narrow angle camera produces noticeably superior low light photos than those available in wide angle mode,['camera']
 The selfie cam also supports standard and wide angle shots  though that s physically just a single wide angle camera,['camera']
  Finally  we have to talk about some of more gimmicky shooting modes LG s cooked up for this weird 18 9 screen,['screen']
 Since that 2 1 ratio means you can have two perfect squares side by side  LG s built its camera software to take advantage of that geometry,['camera']
 For instance  you can shoot one square picture and then match it up with another square for some juxtaposition fun  or take a series of four pics that add up to create their own square  with the other half of the screen acting as a viewfinder ,['screen']
Dual camera smartphones are old news by now  and it seems like there s nearly as many different ways to implement such dual camera systems as there are phones taking advantage of them,"['camera', 'camera']"
 Do you merge the data from both sensors  Should they have similar properties  or attempt to each capture unique image information    LG has already zeroed in on the idea of giving its phones camera with very distinct lenses  one standard  or perhaps telephoto  at least by comparison   and one wide angle,['camera']
 Still  we re just hugely happy to see them come in at the same resolution  and swapping between the two is so fast  it s easy to choose the right camera for any particular shot,['camera']
The beautifully design LG G6 is water resistant with a tall  expansive display and an extra wide angle camera,"['display', 'camera']"
 On paper  the G6 doesn t have as powerful a processor and as long lasting a battery,"['processor', 'battery']"
 LG fans will also be disappointed that said battery is no longer removable  then again  neither is the S8 s ,['battery']
 And while earlier LG was set to announce its big screen  small bezel phone  Samsung s S8 takes the same basic idea and adds more elegance with a unique curved edge twist,['screen']
 Like with previous LG handsets  the fingerprint sensor is built into the home button on the back  which sits below the camera  and not next to it  like with the S8 ,['camera']
 Not all apps and games take full advantage of this ratio though  and when they can t  you ll see black bars on the sides of the display even at full screen  aka  pillarboxing,"['display', 'screen']"
 The longer display works  and seeing that you get more screen for about the same build size  I m all for it,"['display', 'screen']"
 With that said  waterproofing and removable batteries don t tend to go together these days  so the fact that the G6 does not have a removable battery was kind of a given,['battery']
 After the LG G2 in 2013  the company has been one of the few holdouts to feature swappable batteries in its flagship phones  so people can switch a drained one for a charged one or replace an old battery with a fresh one,['battery']
 Keep in mind that if you take wide angle shots  angles will be distorted and elongated from the side  especially when it comes to selfies with the front facing camera,['camera']
 I also found that the front facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low light,['camera']
 But the G6 captures sharp and vibrant images regardless  and other than blurry selfies in the dark  you ll be satisfied with the camera setup,['camera']
 By going with a simple  sleek design  a water resistant body and a feature packed camera  LG is giving phone users what they want,['camera']
 Unless you want to be on the absolute edge of technology  the idea of being saddled with  last year s  processor shouldn t be a huge deal  and the advantages of the 835 aren t that dramatic on paper,['processor']
 In the real world  the usual differences between one superfast processor and another are hardly discernible,['processor']
 Apps launched and quit promptly  the camera operated quickly and the display was responsive,"['camera', 'display']"
    For more information  check out our video on the G6 s camera  the slideshow below and our gallery for outdoor photography with the G6,['camera']
    One of my favorite things about the camera is a new interface that shows you five of your most recent photos  like a gallery stream,['camera']
 LG added a separate camera app called Square Camera too,"['camera', 'camera']"
  For more on how Square Camera works  watch the video below and check out our explainer,['camera']
 LG also hopes that the G6 s increased battery capacity  from 2 800mAh in the G5 to 3 300mAh  and new wireless charging feature    just for the US    can offset the benefits of a swappable battery,"['battery', 'battery']"
com  doesn t have a removable battery either,['battery']
 Its 3 000mAh battery clocked an average of 16 hours of drainage time,['battery']
 Samsung also said the overall life expectancy of the S8 s battery life will last longer as well  years down the road,['battery']
  In addition to its beautifully glossy design and screen  the G6 is dust  and water resistant like the S8s  the Apple iPhone 7s and several Sony Xperia phones,['screen']
7 inch screen takes up roughly 80 percent of the front of the phone  leaving it with an impressively thin bezel all around,['screen']
 In its place is a slim  water resistant build whose screen takes up an enviable 80 percent of the phone face,['screen']
 There s an entirely obvious reason for that   for a modern smartphone of any kind  the screen is a good deal taller than any previous model,['screen']
 And while the curved glass back panel has echoes of Samsung s Galaxy line  the front is almost aggressively flat  with a chamfered metal trim that s essentially flush with the display,['display']
 The G6 is crafted from metal and glass  and now the battery is fully sealed in  so you won t be popping off the back to swap power packs   or  for any other reason,['battery']
 At its core  the G6 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821  not the upcoming 835  which won t be around for another couple of months   backed up by 4GB of RAM,['ram']
 The base model  somewhat disappointingly  only comes with 32GB of storage  though that s offset by the microSD slot  to which heavier content can be offloaded,['storage']
 The new 2 1 display lets LG crank up the information density and introduce some interesting new software features to take advantage of its lanky proportions,['display']
 That taller display lets LG split many of its own apps   like Contacts  Music and Calendar   into two  mostly  equal square sections  with rich visuals up top and extra room for information down below,['display']
 And obviously a taller screen is great for multi window too  allowing you to see more of each individual app,['screen']
 That s a shame  because this kind of gesture shortcut would be amazingly useful on such a tall device  where reaching the top of the screen can be challenging,['screen']
 The G6 s dual camera setup is sure to be one of the more controversial hardware decisions  because on paper it seems like the phone takes a small but noteworthy downgrade  or at best a sidegrade  compared to its immediate predecessor,['camera']
 And although wide angle camera can become grainy in darker conditions  it s miles ahead of the old 8 megapixel sensor from the V20 and G5,['camera']
 This is a fantastic camera setup  with fine detail performance to rival some of the best out there  great dynamic range and punchy  but not unnatural colors,['camera']
 It s also been great to get reacquainted with the 125 degree wide angle camera   a feature I loved in the G5  but soon had to leave behind because the rest of that phone was so disappointing,['camera']
 The G6 s rear shooters make for a much more capable video camera  with software stabilization features that you may remember from the V20,['camera']
 As usual  the regular camera does a bit better in the dark compared to the wide angle,['camera']
 And that s exactly what it s done  with an ample  but not numerically outstanding  3 300mAh internal battery keeping the G6 chugging along,['battery']
 As much as you could argue that the taller display is indeed a gimmick  LG s doing enough with it that it s not just there for the sake of it,['display']
 Most importantly  the core experience of the G6 is flagship class across the board  with a good looking design  top notch display  solid performance and battery life   and that s complemented by a surprisingly great camera setup with some really fun features,"['display', 'battery', 'camera']"
  Since we ve been using the LG G6 with pre production firmware  we ll update this review when we re on final G6 firmware to note any differences  as well as any changes   good or bad   in battery performance over time,['battery']
  On the software side  LG has also expanded its camera app to take advantage of the new 2 1 aspect ratio  with a useful filmstrip view giving showing you your last few photos alongside the viewfinder,['camera']
 However good the Galaxy S8 s camera is  it s basically guaranteed to lack the G6 s wide angle chops,['camera']
  Some of my fellow Mobile Nations editors have been eyeing the G6 s wide angle camera with envy  and I suspect for many phone buyers in the coming months this feature might be what sells them on the G6,['camera']
  Whereas the G5 has a 16 megapixel main camera backed up by an 8 megapixel wide angle lens  the G6 has two 13 megapixel shooters   one wide angle camera at 125 degrees  with an f 2,"['camera', 'camera']"
  So there s parity in terms of megapixel count between both cameras  but because of the disparity in optics  you d expect the wide angle camera to come out a little worse in low light performance,['camera']
  It s just unfortunate that few third party applications are likely to take advantage of the new  taller screen in the same way LG s own apps do,['screen']
  And obviously an 18 9 screen will leave you with unsightly black bars on the sides when you re watching standard 16 9 videos  giving you a significantly smaller viewable area than the 16 9 diagonal of the physical display,"['screen', 'display']"
  Meanwhile  the rounded corners of the screen  while they re a neat design touch  annoyingly don t quite match up with the corners of the bezel   it s a minor thing  but something you can never un see,['screen']
 Although if you re not a fan  these can be easily changed in the home screen settings panel,['screen']
   LG s dual camera system returns  this time with 13 megapixel sensors in both rear shooters   the 71 degree standard camera and the 125 degree wide angle,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The standard camera has a bright f 1,['camera']
 So  predictably  the wide angle camera doesn t perform quite as well in low light,['camera']
  A lot of fuss has been made about the fact that the G6 is technically launching with last year s processor  and that it s stepping down from 13 megapixels in its main camera,"['processor', 'camera']"
  A phone s display is always one of the most important hardware characteristics  and that s especially true of the G6 s extra tall screen,"['display', 'screen']"
  The display is also Dolby Vision and HDR 10 ready  and LG told us the phone would  just work  when HDR content starts to hit the mobile versions of streaming platforms like Netflix,['display']
  You ll still need to deal with curved glass on the back  however that panel is furnished in Gorilla Glass 5  as opposed to version 3 of the material  which makes up the screen,['screen']
7 inch  18 9 display is  given that most videos  shot at 16 9  conjure up black borders on the G6,['display']
  Perhaps the G6 s 18 9 2 1 aspect ratio screen is just this year s LG thing  to be discarded in another 12 months or so in favor of the next thing,['screen']
 There s a solid  if slightly understated phone built around this lanky display  and LG s attitude with its latest handset is less  look at this crazy thing we did  and more  look at our cool new phone,['display']
